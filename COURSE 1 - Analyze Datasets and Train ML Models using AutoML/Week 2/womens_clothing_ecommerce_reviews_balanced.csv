-1,This is a great top but it is really big. i have a similar top from the same brand and the size small fits as expected. this top is easily 2 inches wider everywhere. i would love to exchange it for an extra small  but am afraid that even that size would be too large. the blue pattern is beautiful and the fabric is light and airy  which is perfect for warm days  but the size issue is out of control!,Blouses
-1,I'm sure there's someone out there who will look good in this but it certainly wasn't me. admittedly  i'm a less than ideal body type at a curvy 5' tall. still for a taller person this shirt runs short  for a curvy person this does nothing to accentuate a waist  for a short person this pattern is very busy even if the colors are beautiful  for a busty person the gathers around the chest make for a very frumpy look  and even for a short and thin person this shirt runs too big to get a good fit. c,Blouses
-1,I'm 5' 7 and bough a size 8 regular. this is so short that if you wear with jeans you can see a midriff. cute pattern  but i'm returning it.,Blouses
-1,"This top was just not flattering. i'm 5'8"" and medium build  and the m was very bulky and the fabric didn't fall in the right places. made me look very round and i'm not  so it's definitely going back!",Blouses
-1,I tried on this top and it looked fine until i tried to move. you can't lift your arms. i tried on a larger size but still felt like the movement was limited in the back and arm areas.,Blouses
-1,Like the previous review said  i was excited to receive this top. i had grand visions of all the ways i could wear it! to my chagrin  when i put it on  it just fell right down and pooled around my waist. i wish there were smaller sizes to order. sadly  this is going back.,Blouses
-1,I liked the design and i didn't mind that is see through  but i couldn't put it on ! not size 8 what is my usual size   not size 10 or 12  even 14! my shoulders wouldn't go through the middle part and it is not stretchy   so disappointed. i really wanted to like it.,Blouses
-1,I initially liked the feel and quality of the top but once it was on it was much shorter and looser than the picture of the model. it flowed out from my chest with one central pleat in the front and my husband said it made me look pregnant. then came the tedious task of taking it off with such a snug fit in the shoulders. i'm regularly a size 2/xs  32d and 120 lbs and both size 2 and 4 did not work for me.,Blouses
-1,I love maeve and was so excited for this top which looked like an update from a last season favorite. unfortunately the fabric was stiff  it was tight in the chest and went straight down from there. returned.,Blouses
0,This is a beautiful top but the fit is odd. it's roomy and flowy in the bust and waist but the arms are disproportionately tight. i wear a size 8 in all hd in paris tops but this one didn't fit anything like the others. i wouldn't even know what size to recommend because it's almost too big in the body  while being too tight in the arms. the lace and mock neck is beautiful though so i'm hoping to find someway to wear it comfortably. otherwise  it will be going back.,Blouses
0,I had high hopes for this top  as it looked great online. unfortunately it was much more ruffly in person and not my style at all. it was a lot of fabric and poofed out too much -- reminded me of a child's top. sad to return it!,Blouses
0,This shirt is really cute but a little stiff. it does come with a slip  but the slip was tight  but the shirt fit  maybe even a little big. i used another cami under which was better. i think think the sizing is off in terms of slip vs. the actual shirt. i got it in the store with the 30% off  so it was a good deal. it does stretch out as you wear it  so it will get bigger and it did make me look a little bigger  but still cute on and for a summer shirt  it's thin  so it does work well in that r,Blouses
0,Fabric was a little more shear than i thought it would be - while not a big deal - it was missing a few of the silver beads along the front line of the top. returned,Blouses
0,This top runs small across the top. i was amazed at the material--polyester  i am sure--because the price was so high. it has a sheer layer underneath  which i think would make it hot in the summer. i love this kind of tank but it just did not look as good as it does online.,Blouses
0,I think this top would have been amazing if it was in a jersey or cotton club but the gauzey fabric is so wrinkly and so sheer i don't know how i would use this top. i don't mind most of the slightly sheer retailer tops (if people see my bra slightly so be it) but this is really sheer  unless you are madonna you are going to want to wear something under this  and in my mind  that defeats the purpose of a lightweight  sleeveless top. i returned it and was sorry to have to do that.,Blouses
0,"This shirt is not awful but not anything pretty. there's a reason the main photo has the model with her arms crossed over the waist! it runs good on top and then you get to the body of the garment and it runs straight down yet the pleats even make it manage to expand a little but then you get to the lovely detailed hem which reins them in. so now you are left with a bit of a poof effect making you rounder in all the wrong ways. it's one of those  ""i'm too lazy to send it back it's not that awful",Blouses
0,This top is beautiful to look at but did not fit me like the model. it was tight across the bust but very poofy at the bottom  which normally i like  but not this time. sad.,Blouses
0,This blouse is so cute...casual but still stylish. the problem was that is is a little short for someone with a long torso and it is almost too revealing...the v is so plunging you would have to either pin it our wear a cami. the beads on the ties on the sleeves are also rather heavy and they swing and roll around on your arm...maybe wouldn't bother some but it was a return for me.,Blouses
1,The reviews are accurate that have already been said about the material and size. i usually wear a size 2 and i bought a size 4. it fits perfectly. the blouse is very sheer  but if you wear a neutral colored bra  it should be fine. i like the flow and cut of this blouse,Blouses
1,I bought the black motif  the design lends to a nice pop of color.  the venting detail on the back is beautiful  but probably not as obvious on the black.  maeve is one of my favorite retailer designers.  i'm usually between a s/m or 6/8 in blouses.  i followed advice from other reviewers and got the 8- for room in the arms.  the blouse is very billowy- much more than in the photos  but i'm wearing it with skinny jeans and i love it!,Blouses
1,I said this ran large because i bought a 16 and i normally need a size 18 (i'm busty) if the item doesn't stretch. but  a size 16 fit me. it's more straight and less blousy  but it does fit. so  if you like your tops a little less full of fabric and more tailored but loose  imho you can size down.    the fabric is rayon/polyester that's light and cool. it is semi-sheer but a white bra or nude bra would be fine. the top has a double layer in front. one solid and the over-lay of the embroidery. th,Blouses
1,This top is so beautiful! looks even better in person. i was hesitant because of the price  but i am so happy i bit the bullet and ordered. i am a 36c and the bust is slightly snug.,Blouses
1,This is a lovely and unique blouse. it can be worn with jeans  shorts or a skirt. such a beautiful addition to anyone's wardrobe!,Blouses
1,Darling top  lovely dark rich raspberry red color. runs very large so definitely size down. i ordered the s and m. i am usually m but went with the small. the s was smaller in the shoulders of course but not terribly- it was only an issue when i hugged myself. in the picture it looks like it fits her very well. i don't feel like it fits me quite as well- it's borderline maternity-ish... just a little too large and should come in at the waist just a touch more. i agree the bow i.e. seems weak (fa,Blouses
1,This is a very stylish casual top. it fits great! i plan on wearing it with a long sleeve black tshirt underneath or black turtleneck. i absolutely love the crochet detail at the bottom!,Blouses
1,I love this top! i actually didn't read the reviews prior and ordered a small. the retailer tag on mine says small  but the tag in the shirt is xs. it does run large  so the mix-up was fine by me. the style of the shirt is meant to be loose and light. i love it.,Blouses
1,This one is way better in person. admittedly  i put it in my basket only becasue it was on the stylists picks...well  it is great. a little sheer  adn super static-y when i received it  but oh so soft. the plunge is a tiny bit low for my liking  but this doe'n'tt come in petites so i had to suck it up and keep the regular sie. teh coloring is nice too  neutral  event htough there is rust and navy and greay-ish  it stil lcan be worn with anything..,Blouses
-1,This dress had so much potential. the top was absolutely gorgeous. my issue was with the bottom half of the dress. the bottom is made from a heavy quilted material that is stiff and has no movement at all. the dress is supposed to fit like a modified mermaid dress where its more fitted around the hips and flares out  the dress i received had so much material on the bottom that it actually made my hips look bigger. i though about having the dress altered but decided to return instead.,Dresses
-1,"I am typically a small/6 in dresses  but i should have gone with the other reviewers and sized down. it had no shape  but hung like a paper sack. the armholes fit perfectly though  if i had sized down they may have been too tight. i am 5'6"" 140 lb  i will return  too bad because it is a pretty dress!",Dresses
-1,"After trying several sizes  including petite and regular  i am sad to return this dress. the regular sizes were too long on me (i am 5'4"") and although the petite fit me just a little short  the biggest issue was how tent like it fit me. i wanted it to look like it does on the model but i just couldn't get the fit. usually i have great luck with cloth & stone.",Dresses
-1,This is a beautiful dress. the quality is excellent. the 3 layers and the embroidery are beautiful... however it just didn't look right on me. it looked like a maternity dress. i am very petite  short with a big bust and it just did nothing for me. i think this style would look best on a tall woman with a smaller bust. unfortunately i will be returning this dress.,Dresses
-1,I disliked this dress. it didn't fall on me the way it falls on the model pictured. i think it would work well for tall  thin women with a smaller chest. i am petite with a larger chest  and it accentuated my chest in an unflattering way and managed to make me look frumpy at the same time. not recommended for petite women.,Dresses
-1,The dress is too loose and runs too big,Dresses
-1,I have always bought interesting  pretty  wearable dresses for my daughters at retailer. now the dresses are just retro funky. sad to see.,Dresses
-1,If you have any cleavage this dress will look awful. the ties drop pretty low & look trashy over cleavage. recommend otherwise - good fabric cool look,Dresses
-1,I saw this dress and immediately started daydreaming about wearing it while honeymooning in italy along the amalfi coast or the cinque terre with my husband. and then i tried this dress on and immediately woke up. the cut is a disaster  the quality is terrible  and the dress just plain didn't work. the strips of elastic were sewn unevenly  giving the appearance that there was one large breast and one non-existent breast. the neckline was so long that it had to have the elastic run over the outsi,Dresses
0,This is such a great dress  i hate to return it. it's pretty  a nice material  and an interesting cut. but like other reviewers have said  it is just enormous. if there were a size smaller than xs  or if it came in petite  i would exchange it in a second. but since there's not  it has to go back.,Dresses
0,Loved the fabric and details. the cut was a tad looser/bigger than i expected.  perfect dress for fall.,Dresses
0,The dress is precious and looks good on all body types. however  the bust is extremely tight. i had to go up a dress size just to fit in the chest area.,Dresses
0,"This dress has a unique watercolor-like pattern and design and is silk  but as another reviewer mentioned it is unlined so you probably would want to add your own slip. the side slits come up high  almost to the hip. i am 5'1"" and bought the petite xs and it comes all the way down to my toes if i don't wear a belt. if i belt it  the length is more like one would expect from a maxi dress. i am a little puzzled as to where i would wear this because the length and fancy sleeves make it seem more fo",Dresses
0,This dress is beautiful. the fabric is light weight but textured and interesting  and the purple is gorgeous. the soft pink was a bit more orange than i expected  but not a deal breaker. the problem i had with the dress was fit around the arms. i sized up and was glad that i did because it runs small up top  but because the straps come in a bit around the arm holes  it creates armpit fat  which is not a problem i usually have. i could wear the dress with a sweater  but you wouldn't be able to se,Dresses
0,I just tried on this dress in the store  in red  and i loved the off the shoulder design. the color is just as pictured online (a light poppy red). the neckline began a few inches below my collarbone and was super flattering. however  the skirt portion of this dress flared awkwardly at the hips  causing my hips to look much wider than they really are (and also disturbing the otherwise clean lines of the dress). it seemed to me that there was too much fabric at the back portion of the skirt than,Dresses
0,"I fell in love with this dress when i saw it online and due to the ""slim fit "" i ordered a size up -- a 2 petite up from my normal 0 petite. when i received it  i was surprised about two things: 1) the material was kind of puffy (not bad  just weird)  and 2) it was too big on top - rare for a petite size - even though it fit everywhere else. i wanted to love it  but had to return. would be gorgeous for someone else!",Dresses
0,I bought this on sale thinking it was a great deal  but when it came in i found it to fit like a totally unflattering sack. the pattern didn't help anything  looking totally faded and washed out...the fabric and overall quality is nice  but the fit and pattern are just so..ugly  unfortunately. had to return it.,Dresses
0,Looks better online than in person. material makes it look a little puffy,Dresses
1,A truly gorgeous dress. ran a little too small in the shoulders for me so i had to reorder the next size up. its is very long  but i won't hesitate to have it altered. it is stunning!,Dresses
1,"I think this fits to true to size. i am 5""2 and 107 lbs. i always wear a xs. it was a tiny bit tight in the bust if i wore a big padded bra (34b). if i wore a normal very little padding bra  it did not pull much across the bust.",Dresses
1,"Saw this at the store and it is breathtaking in person. as the previous reviewer stated  i too consider this a dress and not a tunic  and it's not really crinkled either. the dress is structured  very soft  and so gorgeous on. i tried on a regular x-small and it fit but a bit uncomfortable at the mid section. the small fit better (it's meant to be a bit loose  bohemian looking) and the hem falls right at my knees which is perfect for the office (i'm 5'2""  34b  26 waist  36 hips). i have medium o",Dresses
1,"This dress has a flattering and fitted cut which perfectly compliments the unique eyelet fabric. it is at once elegant yet casual  perfect for the office or better yet  afternoon tea in a far flung british colony of yesteryear. which brings me to the buttons - putting on this dress makes one wish one had a ladies maid  but the effort is well worth it for this stunner of a dress. as others have said  it runs small and tight in the chest and is not for the well endowed. i am a petite 5'2"" and fit",Dresses
1,I a looking forward to wearing this dress with a jean or leather jacket. the dress is well made and the fringe adds a nice detail to the otherwise basic design. be sure to order a couple of sizes smaller than your regular size because the dress is huge. i ordered the dress in both colors and am keeping the blue.,Dresses
1,This is one of my favorite retailer dresses of all time. it is soo much better in person and on than the stock photos. very romantic and fun.,Dresses
1,This is dress is great for an occasion - such as a wedding.    i wanted to keep this dress for such occasion - but there were 2 drawbacks. i ordered the dress online and when i opened the package  there it had some sort of oil/petroleum based product smell. the other drawback is the hips - it just flared out more than i wanted. i think that a belt would have solved that  but i usually don't find belts in my size.    as for the fit  it is true to size. i'm a true petite and the 00p fit great!,Dresses
1,I am 5'4 and a curvy girl and find this dress to be super flattering in fit and length. i got a size 14 which is my typical size. the slip is a little tight in the bust area for me so i find it easier to put on first and then the dress over which is possible because it snaps in and out at the shoulders. it arrived super wrinkled but i found tossing it in the dryer for a few min helped - is it dry clean which is slightly high maintenance but so cute it's worth it. great dress for transitioning in,Dresses
1,"I do love this dress. i wore it for my 20th anniversary party and received numerous compliments. it's great for embracing your curves. it has a wonderful ""vintage-made-modern"" flair that classic retailer pieces always have. you do have to be careful when wearing it...jewelry or belts may snag the intricate lacework. i am definitely the type of shopper who waits for a sale. this is one of the few pieces i felt i could splurge on. it is just that unique. i hope that retailer continues to carry these t",Dresses

1,Be aware that this cardigan runs small- as you can see on the model  it's a form-fitting style. it's not the kind of cardigan you would unbutton and take on and off as a layering piece. i would wear it more like a top with a button-up front. it is nice and soft and the black and white scalloped design is attractive. i would recommend it if you are looking for a more fitted top with this design. i'm not wow-ed by it  but it's nice in a 50's kind of way.,Fine gauge

1,These are great  the colors are a little different in real life. they are really great but i think they are a bit delicate and i hope they hold up.,Intimates
1,Great piece just wish it fit a bit more blousy rather than cami,Intimates
1,I love the look of this bra  but unfortunately it is pretty skimpy and sheer. i need a little more padding to define my shape and i wish it had modesty padding. this wasn't for me so i returned it.,Intimates
-1,I really loved this vest online and decided to try it on in store. it was really cute on and fit nicely so i purchased it (in my normal size) and took it on a vacation. first time wearing it and the color transferred all over my white shirt even though it says it is pre-washed. i am very disappointed considering how expensive this was. overall  it is very cute but it may ruin your clothes so beware!,Jackets
-1,I wish this fit me better. i love the inside fur. it is extremely soft but it doesn't look flattering at all. it makes my shoulders look really broad and it was shorter in the length than i wanted. it wanted it fit over my butt (or cover half) and it sits a little below my waist. unfortunately i am taking it back. great idea though.,Jackets
-1,This jacket has cute details. i like the front pockets and color. it has no shape and is about 1 size bigger than marked. i felt like a sack of potatoes in it.,Jackets
-1,Loved the design but jacket looked like 20 years old because of a lot of piling even brand new jacket at store. i wish they use better quality fabric so i would have purchased it.,Jackets
-1,"I didn't receive a jacket. i received a very expensive cardigan sweater with no structural qualities to it. jackets have some structure to them. for example they might nip in at the waist a bit. this cardigan doesn't do that. it hangs in a very boxy shape. the quality is great. very light weight and i really love the little pockets and details  but i don't need/want another cardigan.     i'm 5'5""  118 lbs and got a small. the small seemed big  but i think it would have fit fine if it had more st",Jackets
-1,Does not look like the picture. lined with a cheap denim fabric inside that shows when arms are rolled up. i normally always fit in mediums and this jacket is so small in the arms as well as body that it fit like a xs.,Jackets

-1,I was leery of purchasing this blazer online without any reviews to read...and now i know better. the color and fabric are nice and what you would expect from the photos. the sleeves  however  ran small compared to the body. the shoulders also pulled and felt narrow compared to the torso. the body the opposite...too large and not flattering on an hourglass figure...no darts  no fitted places  nothing making it tailored to fit. open it hung wide with an unflattering silhouette. buttoned  it sprea,Jackets
-1,1. i like a shorter jacket  but this one was poorly made and poorly fit.  2. the sleeves were way too tight. i'm a size 10 or 12  and the large which would be a 14 had tight sleeves that wrinkled up my arms  and the hem of the sleeve turned inside out.  3. i ordered both a medium (size 10) and a large (size 14)   and neither hung right. the m too tight  and the large too loose in the body and too tight in the sleeves.  4. very polyester with lots of static.  5. cute idea  but not very good in pe,Jackets
0,"Tried the navy in store. boy does it run big! i'm normally a size 6 / small (ish). 5'6""  34a-28-36. the xs was still quite boxy on me while the sleeves were well fitted. i understand this is the style and i like the design with the different sleeves. it was a no buy as the main fabric was already pilling in store and looked a bit cheap - sorry!",Jackets
0,Delaine blazer so many little details with a slight bit of ruggedness. loved the unmatched buttons  checkered back and fraying that gave this piece personality making it appear less stuffy. easyily dress it up or down  that being said it seems to run true to size except the arms and shoulders were very tight. i would consider going up a size if more of an athletic build. ordered a 4 but i think a 6 would have been perfect!,Jackets
0,"The kimono is as pictured. the colors are true to what is shown on line  though the description indicates ""green multi""--it is not green. i returned the item  however. the quality is fine  but it seemed extremely over-priced to me. it seems to me that half the price would be fair for the quality.",Jackets
0,Ordered my regular size large and the fit was a snug around my hips when snapped. i didn't plan on wearing it that way so that wasn't a deal breaker for me. but because i have a larger bust i felt the padding added pounds and lots of width to my frame. i also had the same issues with coloring as other reviewers. and lastly  the collar is really high and it just bugged me. so this one went back.,Jackets
0,"Loved the look of this wool and so well made! problem was it literally would have been better on a bed as a blanket than on my body as a blanket coat. just overwhelmed me and didn't look good. i'm 5/9"" and 160 lbs so i'm no shrinking violet just too heavy of fabric.",Jackets
0,Was looking more for a tailored  blazer like chino jacket. this was just too bulky. usually wear a 00p  ordered the 00  and could have put a chunky sweater underneath. 5'4''  110 lbs  32c for reference.,Jackets
0,I don't mind loose-fitting clothing  but to say that this product runs large is an understatement. no amount of pulling  tying  pinching could help me get this jacket to fall the way it does on the model in the photo. the arm holes are a foot in diameter for artistic purposes  and the jacket itself is meant to flow far away from the body  i guess. if you try to taper it in with the strings  then end result resembles a rounded beach ball. very disappointed  especially since the design on the fabr,Jackets

1,I was wavering on this post purchase but then decided to wear it to a store opening event and double digit people asked me where i got it or commented that they liked it. i guess i made the right decision! the inside is a super soft gray jersey knit. wears great with black.,Jackets
1,I first saw this jacket hanging at the store and it didn't look very cute. i saw it again on sale so i decided to try it on. i'm so glad i did! the inside gray material is so soft. i have broad shoulders and this jacket did not hinder my arms at all. it is very comfortable. i bought the x-small and was very surprised at how roomy it was. the sleeves are a tad bit long but the gray inner lining has an elastic cuff so it can be pushed up. not sure if the xx-small would've been too small or if the,Jackets
1,This is even cuter in person than it is in the picture. it was hanging on a rack by the dressing room  so i tried it on on a whim and loved it! so  so soft too! runs true to size. i am 5'2 and 125 and got a small.,Jackets

1,I joked with my husband that if i were with the resistance  (star wars)  this is what i would wear! i actually really like it. it will look best with a girly skirt and blouse. the quilting is lightweight and the fit is slim. well made too.,Jackets
1,I'm always on the lookout for pieces that look polished  but aren't fussy. this is *that* blazer. i'm rather petite and bought the xs  though wish they had the petite in store to try on as xs is not very fitted on my frame. the perfect weight for 65 degree summer days.,Jackets
1,This jacket is so pretty and fits amazing! i ordered the size small and it fits as expected. i normally wear a size small and a size 4.,Jackets
1,I knew this jacket would be mine as soon as i saw it online  but i also have a hard time trusting retailer's online photos by their color and angle etc.     i took a gamble and  for the most part  it paid off. i do like the jacket's unique bohemian gone chic/uptown styling and the gorgeous patten with a spattering of embroidery on the chest and back. what i don't like is the mix of black leather trim and big brass studs. i feel like there might be one too many ideas  or they could have been toned,Jackets
-1,I'm normally a size 25p. i bought these in a 26 because i wanted a more relaxed fit. i could barely pull them up over my calves. i could get them on and button them  but i felt like a sausage stuffed into a straw. size up 2 sizes at least!,Jeans
-1,Long-time ag jeans fan. lately though  i'm finding the material is much too stretchy. i wanted a good pair of jeans. if i wanted pajama jeans  i would've ordered them. i found the same thing with the steve capris i ordered (same review there).  so back both pairs went.   it's a shame because the color was as pictured and just what i wanted. if only they had been made out of actual jeans material.,Jeans

-1,I ordered first the green  then the grey (in case the green was mismarked.)  so short!!  is this to be in keeping with the ankle pant trend??  anyone who wants a shorter pant could easily hem them. but there is no way to lengthen them.  i held the new pants up to an older pair from previous years. they are a full 2 1/2 inches shorter! wow!  note how in the photo of the golden color pants they barely skim the model's ankle. that's how they are in real life.  i wear these pants in a tall  and live,Jeans
-1,Ag jeans have been a main stay for me. they are the most comfortable and best looking jeans on my body. however this pair was too tight and shorter then i liked. the fabric and color is beautiful. i wear the same size for ag no matter the design. but this one ran too small. i have to return it. i will try the next size up if they still have them.,Jeans
-1,I love how these jeans look on. tts  adorable. i exchanged my first pair due to stitching coming out in the back right pocket. pair #2 -the stitching came out in the exact same place. this seems to be a problem with the quality/sewing. the fact that the stitching is gold and decorative as well as functional means it will keep unraveling until the jeans are ruined. 2nd pair has to go back. too bad.,Jeans
-1,As another reviewer wrote.. this is not the same jean featured on the website. same cut and style but it's a light denim wash with wiskering and worn look at the knees. i called customer service to see if this was a mistake and they said there was not really a way to check it unless i exchanged them. i didnt want the same wrong jeans again so i opted out ... too bad they are cure.,Jeans
-1,"These are terribly unflattering the wash looks dirty and the rise is not 10.5 like the description says  which is the only reason i gambled on these it is 13"".",Jeans
-1,I love my very old pilcro stet jeans. they are the perfect denim weight  and the back pockets are set in a way that is very flattering for the tush. not so with the newer pilcros unfortunately. the denim is thinner and may have more stretch and they get worn and pill on my inner thighs. and the back pockets are set far apart making my back side look unnaturally wide. it's a bummer.,Jeans
0,Fit is just like stet in my opinion.,Jeans
0,I love pilcros and tried everything to get these to work. one size down  two sizes down  no matter what  they just don't look right. the droopy look didn't work for me.,Jeans
0,I am a huge fan of pilcro pants  and was so excited to see them make a pair of vegan leather pants. the idea is great - leather in the front  fully stretchy fabric in the back to give a fitted but comfortable look. however  i couldn't get past the way the seams and leather felt on my knees - really stiff and uncomfortable when you start walking around (can't bend the leg all the way; weird creasing and bunching behind the knee). the fit was perfect everywhere else. sadly  these had to go back :(,Jeans
0,Stretch out fast    5 8 130lb i order size 26 which is my usually size. they fit prefect for about 3hr and then stretched out feeling not right on my body. maybe i should have gone down a  sizes. even so i feel like the $$$ and quality don't add up but they are very soft and comfortable  i wouldn't buy them again.,Jeans
0,I really like the pilcro serif style but the stet style does not work for my body. will have to return.,Jeans
0,I have been looking for a quality pair of black skinny jeans for a while. after reading the reviews  i had such high hopes for these jeans. i bought it in my usual size 28 and while the top part fit perfectly  i found that the bottom was too tapered in and ultra skinny making it not look right. sadly  i had to return.,Jeans
0,I still have mixed feelings about this pants. the fabric is nice  soft and flows well. the fit is good  i ordered 30  could have gone with 29  not a big deal. the one thing that is off is the length - i am 5.7 and these come right to above my ankle...nowhere close to how they sit on the model. the issue with this length is that is neither here nor there  too short for regular pant length and too long for crops. i will probably have to hem them a bit  which is a disappointment when you pay so muc,Jeans
0,I wear a 32 and sometimes a 31 but i could barely squeeze these on in a 32. the fabric is thick with lots of stretch but these are super skinny all the way to the ankle like a legging and not a jean. made for much thinner frames than mine.,Jeans

1,The jeans are even better in person. great fit and the color is nice. my new fave!,Jeans
1,These jeans are my favorite skinny jeans. they are expensive but so worth it. i had nordstrom reinforce holes with patches so they still look distressed but won't rip further. i wear these at least once a week.,Jeans
1,"I have athletic calves from running  so i really struggle with straight/skinny jeans. but these fit me just fine (and don't look like jeggings). i think the slit helps. i have a 29"" inseam and these hit just above the ankle. great find - especially on sale.",Jeans
1,"I love that these are a nice thin stretchy material (not in a bad or cheap way) because they are perfect for the warm weather as well. i got the color grey in a size 29. i usually wear a 29 in stevie's so they were tts. maybe a bit tight in the beginning but they do stretch a little with wear. i did try on the size 30 but they were a little big around the waist. for reference i am 5'6""  145lbs  size 6/m. the fit of stevies are perfect and hugs in all the right places. i have wider calves and it",Jeans

1,I disagree with the reviewer that says these are more straight-legged. for me they fit tight throughout. sits perfectly on the waist with just enough stretch  but they still look very structured. i'm 5'0  110 lbs and the 26 fit me perfectly. the length was perfect for my height. often pants are too loose in the ankle for me  but these are snug and perfect to wear with booties.,Jeans

-1,I was really excited about this top since i have others from retailer that are similar in styling. unfortunately  it just didn't work out. i am petite with a short torso and ordered my usual size and it was way too short in the front. the top was also boxy and didn't sit right. it just wasn't flattering. cute top on the hanger  but just not on me.,Knits

-1,I purchased this shirt in blue hoping it would be a basic add-on to my wardrobe. it's been about a month and i have since washed and worn it twice. the color is now fading and i found a hole in the front of the shirt! i'm not sure if its the fine fabric that caused it to tear  but i washed it on gentle cycle and didn't do anything that would have warranted a tear. sadly this did not serve up to its purpose. i wouldn't suggest paying the price tag or even sale price for an item that i don't expec,Knits
-1,The back of this t-shirt looks cute but the front looks really weird. the material in the back is quite stiff but the grey material is soft  so the front gray area ends up hanging weirdly and looking uneven and messy. i appreciate asymmetrical clothing but to me it looked like a patched up rag from the front. it fits true to size.,Knits
-1,After seeing this on anthto's facebook page i was so excited to order. i ended up going to a store and trying on. i couldn't believe it was the same shirts when i first saw it. i thought this ran quite big. and the shape was odd. lots of material in the middle. i am a mom of 3 young kids and didn't want people to think #4 was on the way.,Knits

-1,I love baseball style tees and when i saw the homebase tee (in two colors no less)  i was very thrilled especially since it was during the 20% mother's day promotion on all items. based on the model's photos  the top looks flattering with a swing type style. i usually wear a medium and bought a small size in this top. when the package was delivered  i excitedly opened it and found two tees looking like maternity tops which would be lovely if i was pregnant. the tops are so wide not like the webs,Knits
-1,This tunic is a perfect length for leggings. the mauve color got rave reviews on my first wearing. and the mixed media and asymmetrical styling gave the garment a unique appeal and made it quite flattering. however  when i wore it a second time  i noticed two micro holes in the sleeve. one near my wrist and the other at the shoulder. since i take extreme care when laundering my clothes  it seems this will have to be a return as the jersey knit is not strong enough to hold up in the delicate cycl,Knits
0,Billowy top - perfect for casual comfort. the topic is definitely not raspberry-- it is a sunset orange. disappointed as i was going for a match. i should have gone off of the picture and not the color name.,Knits
0,The shirt design is very nice  but it fits very loose. it will not look good if you are heavier as this shirt will make you look wider because of the baggy fit. the sleeves though are fitted and feel a little tight. the material of the sleeves also is very itchy and feels like some wool material.,Knits
0,Love the color and design but way to small. i can wear a small in many manufacturers but certainly not in this one. the medium was like an extra small. sorry because i liked what i saw in the advertisement. as an older lady i love your well made  fresh  styles but need to be able to trust that a size is true to form.,Knits
0,I saw this shirt online first and immediately knew i wanted to purchase at least two colors. i went to my local store for the mother's day sale and tried it on in the black/white and the coral/navy. i purchased both colors. i actually wanted to get all three but had some other items i prioritized over the teal/white. it fits great and is super comfortable. i have been wearing the black and white all day today and sadly  it is already pilling and doesn't seem to be holding up very well (photo giv,Knits
0,This sweatshirt is very comfortable and the length of the sleeves is very generous! the bodice is short so you may have to wear a camisole or tank top to avoid exposing your tummy. i usually purchase medium sized tops but had to return for an xl! this runs very small.,Knits
0,Sadly  i returned this one. i'm a 36d bra size and this shirt could not handle that. it fit around my chest  so sizing up was not necessary  but my chest caused the straps to shift and sit funny on my shoulders. cute top and well made for those who can fit into it better!,Knits

0,I bought this top in lilac size s since other reviewers said it has a lot of fabric. the color and the quality were great -- loved that it had the lining underneath. if your bust is bigger than an a cup  beware. the top basically flared out from the farthest point on my bust and the fabric below just hung there. it was a pregnancy look. perhaps that's why the model has her arms crossed in front -- to give the illusion that it tapers in below the ribs  but it does not. unfortunately  this one is,Knits
1,I ordered the navy/green combo in xl and it's prettier in person. the fit matches the model so it's true to size for me. it is loose through the body. it's not slimming but not widening either. if you like how it looks on the model  that's how it should be when you try it on.  it's soft and flowy and perfect for feeling comfortable. i love how the arms and chest are more fitted. the material has give to it. the stitching everywhere was well-done  no loose strands. it's a great basic. i'm going t,Knits

1,A great casual top for warm weather - the linen ensures its structure stands out  and the structure gives it more interest than a plan tee. does a fine job of hiding minor midsection lumpiness. can be dressed up a bit if worn with linen or cotton trousers. i bought the yellow and was pleased to find it wasn't too transparent. i bought the small and found it tts for an american small (bigger than a uk or european small). a versatile keeper.,Knits
1,Usually retailer's designs run small for me  but this large fits great. super comfortable  long enough to wear with leggings. love the back cutout design and fabric choice. depending on bust size  it may seem to sit funny  but it's not meant to be a true baby doll design that sits under the bust. mine looks great :-),Knits
1,"I purchased the purple t with letters all over. great fit  long and not clingy at all. i love the 80's motif/style of the letters. perfect t-shirt for a teacher.  the black design was strange - hearts  fox  cats... it just seemed random and no theme. i would buy colors of this t-shirt because it fits so well  but the black ""green"" design was too off.",Knits

1,I took a risk on this one. i wasn't sure if the shirt was more green or more blue. i look better in blue. it turns out that the shirt is a bit more green  but i think it still looks good! i'm 5'3' and 125 lbs. i got a medium. i could have maybe gotten a small  but i like the medium. the shirt has a bit of a vintage look to it  which i like. all in all good.,Knits

-1,Wow! this sure is close fitting  as in suction cups to your body! yikes  definitely not forgiving for those of us with curves. to me  it seems like the material will wear well. i bought this for a great sales price so i may keep it  not sure. it would work fine as a layering piece but if i gain even 5 lbs  it won't work. i ordered the medium and am usually a small. the large might have worked best but probably still pretty clingy. i do recommend this if you are thin with no problem areas.,Layering

-1,Very poorly made- wide and short  very unflattering. the material is advertised as cotton  but it felt very synthetic.,Layering
-1,This top is beautiful - even more so in person. however  like a previous reviewer  the fit is very boxy. there is so much excess fabric that poofs out on the sides that you can't see in the photos due to the model's cardigan and arms. if this top had been a bit longer and more fitted  without all the excess fabric at the bottom  it would have been perfect. again  the color  the lace  the fabric and the pleating is all gorgeous. would love it if the designer took this into consideration and came,Layering

0,This seemed to run a little bit small on me... more form fitting than on the model in the photo. also  it's thin. i'd be sold on it for sure if it were just a little longer too because i like the almost-lingerie-like look. the lace applique is pretty  and if you purchase it for that  then it really shows up better on the two lighter colors - it really gets lost all in black.,Layering
0,I nearly always wear a size small  and sometimes even a small is too large. not in this case; this top is extremely snug. i would not be able to wear this  and i would've returned for a larger size but the ivory color was a little too yellow for me. in the online photo. the color is more of an off-white than ivory yellow. i'm guessing also that this fabric may not stand the test of time and easily snag. but that's just conjecture.,Layering
0,I loved this when i got it. it has such a flattering fit! slightly loose in the body  but not flowy. nice weight of fabric. comfortable fabric. perfect scoop neck that doesn't show too much cleavage. but i washed it once on delicate and line dried (which i do with most of my shirts) and it came out riddled in holes.,Layering
1,I love this style of tank top with the wider straps. very flattering but yes the armholes are big and i noticed the sizing is different with each color. i normally wear an xs but in the gray and blue i bought s to have a little room. i also bought the black color but the s was huge! i exchanged for an xs so hopefully it will fit better. it had to be ordered. it definitely stretches out as you wear it though.,Layering
1,Originally i bought this in black and white. recently purchased several more in different colorways . why? it's just perfect to wear as an under tank/cami. i'm a busty gal and sometimes cami straps can be too thin and dig into my shoulders. this is soft  smooth and provides just enough coverage. very flattering fit on its own as well. great under loose knit or low cut sweaters. love!,Layering
1,This is great  lightweight top layer that's just right for the little evening chill in the summer when the sun goes down  or on a breezy day. it's sheer  so it requires a bottom layer. the medium fits a little tighter across the shoulders and arms for me than it shows on the model  which i like.,Layering
1,I love this shimmer tank-in both colors! it is a very thin fabric-thinner than i would have expected  but i think this is okay since i would use it for layering and probably never wear it as a standalone tank. i think you can never go wrong with sparkles  especially in a layering tank-it dresses up or fancies up the outfit. the straps on this tank are not adjustable  and if you are large chested  i think a lot of cleavage would show in this tank. i would have preferred the sleeves are very sligh,Layering

1,I orderd this product in a size large  because i was afraid of it being seamless would make it too tight on my larger chest (32ddd)  however the opposite happened. because it doesn't have any kind of seams it is very boxy and not skin tight like i expected  however it still works because it does fit me around my chest comfortably and when worn under something it gives a nice blouson effect. also  the v is a very nice depth- not too deep or too shallow. overall  i'm happy with it because it's a n,Layering

0,I love the fit of these pants. i bought them in several colors  but unfortunately when i laundered the teal blue pair  the places where the liquid detergent touched them (not bleach  detergent) look like they've touched bleach. i washed them in cold with regular detergent but will be unable to wear them after one wear. i was confused and even checked the detergent to make sure it did not have bleach in it  and it does not. very disappointing and i hope this is not true of the dye in the other co,Pants
0,These are cute and light weight however the fit is off. i ordered my normal size large (i'm a 12/14.). the waist was large but fit ok. they were really tight across the theighs. the crop length is fine with my 5'9 height. if i hadn't got such a good sale of probably return them. they will be good lounge pants.,Pants
0,These pants are cute. they seem  to me  to have a wider leg than appears on the model. they do run big  so i would recommend sizing down if in doubt. these are cute pants that can be dressed up or down  but unfortunately  look pretty sloppy by the end of the day  as they stretch and wrinkle very quickly. since they already run a bit big  this is a major negative. i wore them to church  and they were quite wrinkled by time i got home. by late afternoon  they looked like a different pair of pants.,Pants
0,Ok  if i had a different body  this would be awesome but i have a big butt and meaty thighs so just did not flatter me. although my husband couldn't tell that the pants were tugging on me (thanks to the pattern it does camouflage)  it was uncomfortable. so if you are built like me  this isn't the jumpsuit for you.     this is a well made garment but there is no give in the butt and thigh area (hence would not recommend for my thick thighed sisters).     for reference  i am 5'3 and 150 pounds. th,Pants
0,I had high hopes for this jumpsuit for a holiday party but it is a very odd fit. i'm normally a 10-12  preferably a petite. i ordered this in a large and i couldn't begin to zip it up. it also ran extremely short in the crotch area. very pretty print but it's going back!,Pants

1,I always coveted a pair of flower camos that my sister used to wear. they were perfect  fitted  but not too  casual but not too. i saw these and thought to myself that i finally found them  that i didn't have to covet my sister's pants any more. these check all the boxes--comfy  stylish  high quality  but by the end of the day  they bag out. when i wore them  i had to keep pulling them up--a belt would certainly help. so  i love the pants  but am a bit disappointed with how they lose their shape,Pants
1,These are great pants! i sized up from my typical size 28 because i found the rise to be a little low for me. i tend to like my pants a little higher on my waist. the sa said these ran a little smaller for most. when i got home  i put them up to my size 28's and they were the same.

1,I am pretty obsessed with these and wish i could get them in many more patterns. the fit is ultra comfortable and true to size. the style allows you to put on a t-shirt  sweater  cardigan + t  whatever  and look completely put together. i got loads of compliments on them on the first day i wore them.,Pants
1,I wish these fit more like joggers  but they are slightly poofier. with the big buttons  i felt a bit too clownish. however  it's a great statement piece if you're up for it. the quality is good and the fabric has a nice texture. i think the problem was that since linen doesn't drape and scrunch like less structured fabrics  so it holds more volume instead of loose  semi-flowy menswear look. i,Pants
1,I tried on this jumpsuit on a whim and bought it immediately. finding a jumpsuit for my body type is hard (small chest  rounder in the middle and hips like whoa) but i have to say this one is ridiculously flattering. love the quality and feel of the fabric. i've worn it both braless and with a bandeau and have not needed to wear a shirt underneath  but then again it isn't a piece i plan to wear to work. i'm usually a sz 8/10 and got the medium regular which is perfect. i'm 5'5 and the bottom hit,Pants

-1,I really wanted to love the shorts.  when i read that the shorts were lined  i expected them to be lined so that my underwear didn't show.  even though the shorts are lined  you can see through the fabric completely.  this was absolutely disappointing since the shorts have a lovely exterior design; pockets; and  comfortable waistline.  i'm returning the shorts as well.,Shorts
-1,The picture makes the shorts look structured. i assumed they were made of a heavier cotton material. i was disappointed when they turned out to be a light weight polyester.     also  this runs way too big. i am busty and did not fill out the top of the xs.    i wouldn't even buy this at the sale price.,Shorts

-1,These are my all time comfiest shorts and i am obsessed with the lavender color. sadly  using free and clear detergent on a cold  delicate cycle made the color turn splotchy  and they are unwearable. this happened once and i exchanged for another pair  but i'll be returning this pair. i'll be sad to see my favorite color go  but there is obviously a defect in the dye used. maybe i'll try another color!,Shorts

0,I am so sad that this romper didn't work out. it's just way too billowy and huge. i am usually between a small and medium so i ordered this small. i'm petite and somewhat curvy and i was absolutely swimming in this romper! might look best on taller girls. i am 5 '2 and about 125-130 lbs and this was like wearing a tent. do not recommend. such a bummer because i was a believer after treading all of the great reviews!,Shorts
0,The fabric is super soft and comfortable and the look is cute  however the drape on the front crossover is not great and doesn't flatter well. the shorts will probably run a little on the short side for some - i'm very short (5') and the length is great for me but i'm guessing not for the average height.,Shorts
0,This romper was not what i expected when i originally purchased. it is much more casual looking in person  and as soon as i got it out of the bag  one of the buttons fell off. it did look good on and fit well  but i will be returning because it is too casual for the occasion i bought it for.,Shorts
0,I can't believe how small these are. i almost wondered if the size was marked incorrectly. these are so pretty and such a shame because i love them. the rise in the crotch is also very short. very full in the legs and one is longer than the other:( the stripes don't line up in places which is also disappointing for this price!,Shorts
0,I'm pretty disappointed in these. just bought the yellow pair and wore today for the first time. super cute and very comfortable. i was in love with them. they got two small stains on them from the day's activities ( and not even crazy  untreatable stains). unfortunately  the stains did not budge yet the color of the shorts washed out. they are completely ruined after one washing (on cold). i'm hoping this was a fluke and plan to order a second pair before they sell out. these will be going back,Shorts

0,The geometrical pattern of this sweater is slightly asymmetrical  with nice geometry to it. the colors are more muted and subtle as compared to the picture. i was very excited to see it through its transparent bag. unfortunately my delight faded after i pulled the sweater out. first  it weighs a ton. a thread for each color runs around he whole sweater  hence much more thread went into it than in a typical sweater. second  it runs large. i am usually an xl or 16-18  but this sweater has lost of,Sweaters

0,Very lovely sweater - lightweight with cute detailing at the side of the waist  sweet but not saccharine bow at the back of the neck. i really wanted to love this sweater  but it had to go back because it looked  um  used. pilling along the arms before i even got to wear it? it got returned  sadly.,Sweaters
0,This sweater is beautiful  especially in the bordeaux color. the cable knit in varying directions makes it interesting and unique and the length is great for us short waisted ladies. my big issue with this sweater is the sleeves. there really are no sleeves  just arm holes at the same level as the hem of the sweater  so you feel as if you need to keep your arms pinned to your sides to keep from lifting the sweater up to expose your midsection  or pushing the sleeves way up  which then results in,Sweaters
0,"I was so excited to order this beautiful coat.  it does seem well made and is very soft.  unfortunately  the fit is completely off and is overall large.  i ordered a small  as this coat appears slightly more snug on top  a-line on the bottom  with three buttons.  i am 5'6"" and weigh approximately 145.  i was expecting this coat to be body-skimming.  instead it was overall large and the bottom of the coat awkwardly flared.  the  pleat on the back is unflattering.  sadly going back.",Sweaters
0,"I really wanted to like this sweater. it was featured in the dressing room and i am a sucker for animal prints. the dog print is unique  a ""mossy"" fuzzy print  and the grey really shows off the dog print. i like regular xs because i like the fitted look (i am 5ft2in  34b  26 waist  36 hips)  the hem falls at my upper hip and the sleeves fall a bit pass my wrists. but  if you do not wear a turtleneck under it  you will scratch all day long. the designer should try on the fabric before selling it!",Sweaters
0,I love the concept of an airy  flowing sweater that has great detail. this item stole my heart online. however  i am fairly petite (5'3'') and it looked like it was drowning me. the neck line is decently wide and my small frame couldn't hold it up; it kept falling off my shoulders. i ended up returning. i think it would look and feel fantastic though if i were taller and had broad shoulders.,Sweaters
0,This sweater is incredibly soft and pretty  but there is just no way to get it to lay the way the model does in the picture. i found myself constantly tugging at the top to get it to stay off the shoulder - otherwise it just bunched up top and make a weird funnel neck. i really wanted it to work  but it was just so impractical.,Sweaters
1,I love this sweater. as others have mentioned  it's not the softest acrylic in the world  but i can overlook that for the simple fact that it's adorable. i like the cropped fit- pairs perfectly with high waisted jeans/skirts. the embroidery has a sort of handmade feel to it without looking cheap. the slit up only one side makes it unique in my opinion. i did expect it to be a bit heavier  but it's a great layering piece and ideal for transitioning into colder weather. i may be biased because of,Sweaters

-1,The cutout design of this suit looks cute on the model but didn't flatter my shape. i think it would work better on someone very thin. the criss-cross fabric portion was a bit baggy and didn't sit right. even worse  the bust portion made me look flat (and i'm a full c cup).,Swim

-1,The suit is lovely  but it is very long in the torso and gaps at the leg. i was told that it runs small and to size up to a 10. i did  but i do not think the smaller one would have done better. the bust is fake and it turns out when untied. worst of all it emphasizes the tummy. all in all not a good look for me. i am not heavy but i do need tummy support. normally i wear an 8 and in garnet hill a 6. sorry but it went back. i really wanted to like it.,Swim
