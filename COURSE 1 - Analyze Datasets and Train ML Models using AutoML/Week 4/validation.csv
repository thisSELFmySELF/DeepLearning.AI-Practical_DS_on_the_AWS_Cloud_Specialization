__label__-1 "this is a gorgeous print but i found it too fussy for my taste . it is quite shapeless so i tried doing a half tuck . it looked cute for about 2 seconds but then i had to worry about keeping the shoulders down ."
__label__0 "these are cute and light weight however the fit is off . i ordered my normal size large ( i 'm a 12/14. ) . the waist was large but fit ok. they were really tight across the theighs . the crop length is fine with my 5 ' 9 height . if i had n't got such a good sale of probably return them . they will be good lounge pants ."
__label__1 "surprisingly this poncho is both flattering and soft . i must say i did n't think the fabric would be as soft since a lot of knits have wool but this is great . i purchased both xs/s and xs/s p. the petite was just slightly more fitted so i went with that . i love the boat neck on me it gives the poncho an elegant look . colors are nice and neutral.i think i will wear this with dresses and jeans both . great purchase .

__label__0 "i am a huge fan of pilcro pants and was so excited to see them make a pair of vegan leather pants . the idea is great - leather in the front fully stretchy fabric in the back to give a fitted but comfortable look . however i could n't get past the way the seams and leather felt on my knees - really stiff and uncomfortable when you start walking around ( ca n't bend the leg all the way ; weird creasing and bunching behind the knee ) . the fit was perfect everywhere else . sadly these had to go back : ("

__label__1 "this dress pops ! gorgeous colors and simple classic flowy design . i thought it ran a little big i ended up with xs for best overall fit in chest and a more streamline flow . 34b for reference ."
__label__1 "i have received so many compliments . it 's my favorite"
__label__1 "i tried this on in the store and was pleasantly surprised at how cute it was ! i 'm 5 ' 4 and the large fits me loosely but is still shapely . because it 's a little longer on me it 's great to wear both to work and on the weekends . just wish it came in more colors ! you ca n't see the color in the photo but there 's a sea green lining which is a cute touch !"
__label__1 "i 'm 5 ' 1 and 110 pounds and i ordered the 26 petite . the jeans are fabulous ... flattering .... comfortable ... i could go on and on . the fabric is super soft and the fit hugs in all the right places . it is a nice flare bottom . i will have to wear these with heels or wedges they are too long for flats ."

__label__-1 "read the reviews and thought i would just remove the label asap to prevent snags since i loved the item ! however the item came with unrepairable holes not just snags and they are either on the neck or front sleeve which forces me to return the item asap . did n't even try it on . so sad but i still love retailer ! ! !"

__label__1 "these chinos fit great ! they are extremely comfortable and true to size but note that they do loosen up quite a bit with wear . i bought all 3 colors !"
__label__1 "this is such an easy dress to wear and it looks very polished ! it is not a cheap polyester fabric as one reviewer wrote . it is a rayon and nylon blend . it does wrinkle easily . i love that the belt is actually sewn into the dress at the back . i do n't typically gravitate toward warm color palette but the burnt orange color is really lovely . it can be dressed up or down very easily . and it has pockets ! i typically wear xs in retailer brands and the size 0 fit me well ."
__label__-1 "this blouse has a very cute style . the ruffles are really nice but why does it have to be so sheer ? there is no way i could wear this to work without a cami . it also felt slightly on the small size - almost too tight for my normal size ."
__label__1 "these pants have a very odd design but they are so soft and so comfortable i could not resist . going on a trip to key west and thought they would be great for the plane ride . they fit true to size . could not pass up as they were on sale ."
__label__1 "this sweater is lovely ! i have worn it every other day since i got it . it is soft and warm and elevates everything that you wear it with . i have gotten compliments every time i 've worn it . my daughter who rarely likes the style of clothes i wear said i looked like a winter princess in this ! it is so flattering and comfortable -- -a winning combination !"
__label__1 "the fabric quality and style are amazing . the fabric is very high quality and so soft and the style is nice for an adult . i generally do n't wear shorts because of length style and other problems but i can wear these without feeling like a high schooler . i usually wear a 24/00 in pants i ordered the 0 and was worried that it would be too loose and look sloppy on me but it fits amazingly . one of my favorite purchases ever ! ! !"
__label__1 "these have an amazing fit ! i have them in three colors . they are not too low rise they are not too high . they are the perfect length . the only thing i do not like is the rolled cuff is not stitched and comes down easily if you do not iron down ."
__label__-1 "poor quality material looks much thinner and cheaper than pictured ."
__label__-1 "this dress reminds me of a fabric used for curtains . it is sturdy beautiful and strong . i looked like a large picture window in it . if i was 5'10 and 120 pounds it may have worked ?"
__label__0 "i was confused by this dress . the heavy fabric made me think of winter but the cut and print are springy . it 's also not lined and the material is not exactly soft . i put it back . cute but missed the mark ."
__label__0 "i loved this when i saw it arrive in the mail . as soon as i put it on though i was drowning in it . i know its a cape and it is suppose to be large but it was so big i had to return it . i still really like it and wish it would have worked . i am 5 ' 5 athletic/slim figure just for reference ."
__label__0 "this is pretty and provides coverage with a bit of support for wearing around the house . i 'm a 34b so i ordered the small- it still had room in it so i tightened the straps and used the tightest hooks on the back and that makes it fit ok. i bought it just to wear at home since i was not expecting a great deal of support or shaping and while it feels ok it is not super-comfy- it 's a bit scratchy around the edges . i was going to buy another color if i loved this but as it is i will keep the one"
__label__0 "i recommen only becuase i like it on other people but not on me . the pull on style did n't work i need xs petite to fit lenght and waist but the waist was n't elastic enough to pull up ( i have let 's say a booty # . i kept hearing hte stiching give ... it also looked a little too poooofffy on my frmae i am 5 ' 1.5 and it stuck more out than on the model . nice idea btu not for me . # i am 115 lbs #"

__label__1 "i ordered this dress looking for something to wear out for an evening . after seeing the other reviews i was n't sure about it but i was very pleased when it arrived . i find it is elegant and sexy but also modest enough when i sized up by 1. i normally wear an xs in dresses but found the small fit perfectly . it is form-fitting particularly in the waist and back without being too tight . i 'm excited to wear it and think it would look beautiful with a long necklace ."
__label__-1 "i bought this top in black . it is high quality material and i love the mock neck and zipper in back . however not only are the armholes are too large the shirt is cut too short . if i size down for smaller armholes it becomes a crop top not a flattering look for 50-something me . i really wanted this to work but alas it went back ."
__label__1 "one of the best maxi dresses i have ever found ! i needed a dress that could accommodate a large bust ( 36g ) and camouflage my postpartum belly . the dress did it all . i ordered the large ( 5 ' 7 and 155 lbs ) and it is so flattering . it has just the right amount of coverage up top to prevent looking too busty . and the band around the midsection makes me look much slimmer . like i said best maxi dress ever . price is pretty high but it was worth it !"
__label__-1 "i tried on and bought this shirt in my usual size and it fit long and loose but still had great shape . after hand washing in cold water and air drying as per instructions on the tag the shirt shrunk significantly . so much so that my stomach shows if i raise my arms at all . it also lost its shape and now looks very boxy and is very unflattering . i wo n't be wearing it and am disappointed i did n't even get to wear it once !"
__label__0 "i ordered my normal size in this dress . i am 6 foot tall but the regular sizes were too large and too long ( mid-calf ) . i returned the dress for a size smaller in petite for a more flattering hemline . the dress is lovely especially on the models in the pictures but did n't quite work out for me . also it feels like there are hundreds of closure hooks that make putting on/taking off the dress seem to take an unusually long time !"
__label__0 "i ordered the pink and it was gorgeous . the color and feel were so soft i would have kept it if it were a blanket . but i did send it back because as a sweater it just did n't lay right . it has a sort of inside layer that just did n't fit right with the outside sweater layer so it ended up puffing up on the sides at the waist . that was not flattering . and the hood was too large and floppy looking . too bad ."
__label__0 "i am somewhere between a 24 and a 25 ( i have narrow hips but an average waist ) so i was happy to find that these worked for me in me in a 0. i loved the blue color as an interesting neutral . they did stretch out a little with wear but i still felt like i looked good by the end of the day . i typically really like cotton/linen blends as i can usually wear them out of the dryer if i 'm going for a casual look - a few wrinkles with linen does n't bother me . but these . oh my . when i pulled them out o"
__label__-1 "i bought this top and it ran huge i had to get an extra small . well then i wash it according to the instructions and it shrunk horribly ! like its so small now my 3 yr old could probably wear it ! i 'm so sad i really liked this top .... but for it to shrink after one wear is not acceptable ."
__label__1 "this shirt is amazing ! the soft fabric detailed embroidery and gorgeous little beads/sequins .. all fabulous quality and make this piece worth the price . i love the length and cut of this too - not boxy yet not too tight or fitted ; just covers my bum . can be dressed up or down ."
__label__0 "this top runs large . i am a 34 d and usually a medium or small . the medium was a little loose in the bust but incredibly loose and swingy in the waist . my figure was lost in the fabric . the small was too small for me in the bust although the waist looked more flattering . the coral color was lovely and bright and not too sheer ."
__label__1 "this dress is so much better in person ! i got the petite size ( i am 5 ' 2 ) and it seems to run a bit smaller than the regular size- i have a fairly large bust so i went up a size and it seems to fit perfectly . love the colors and vintage design ! i ca n't wait to wear it for a wedding i will be attending !"
__label__1 "i a looking forward to wearing this dress with a jean or leather jacket . the dress is well made and the fringe adds a nice detail to the otherwise basic design . be sure to order a couple of sizes smaller than your regular size because the dress is huge . i ordered the dress in both colors and am keeping the blue ."
__label__0 "i was very disappointed to receive this and to note that the blouse has no ruffle down the front as pictured . there is no ruffle anywhere on the blouse . i am likely still going to keep it because i like the pattern but the ruffle was what interested me for a cute work blouse and i want other shoppers to know that the blouse actually includes no ruffle when you order it ."
__label__0 "this is a flattering comfortable soft sweater the instant you put it on . a few instants after that however i found mine had relaxed a great deal to become baggy and pilled even more to become a fuzzy wuzzy monstrosity . i 'm not optimistic about its longevity and would n't recommend it except for the extravagant single-use buyer ."
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this top but when i received the picture on the website is a dark charcoal almost black and the grey that you order is much much lighter grey . in addition this shirt is super boxy ... thus why the model probably is pinning her elbows to her side to bring the top in . going back disappointed ."
__label__1 "i purchased the dress on a promotion . the dress i received had the sleeves end about the elbow . i added a 4 black cotton lace to the sleeves . i love the result . it makes the design richer and brings out the lace running down the front of the dress . the sleeves are a much better length for me now . dress runs tts . i purchased a medium am 5 ' 7 150 lbs really am large boned straight up and down ."
__label__-1 "i took advantage of the summer tag sale and bought a few tops including this one . i 've been eyeing this online for quite some time so i was pretty excited to get it at such a good price . it came in the mail the other day . it 's like christmas morning when you see an retailer package at your door however this time was n't so great . the top is fine . average at best . the top fits true to size . maybe it 's the pattern or the cut but it did n't work well on my body . i recommend trying this on first ."
__label__1 "this is the most flattering shirt -- love the fit and color !"
__label__-1 "i thought this suit would be the perfect solution of stylish but forgiving of my new mom bod . this one did n't work for me . i ordered the medium . the top is very small -- i would recommend only for b cup or smaller . the full coverage bottoms did nothing for my shape . it seemed to make me seem rounder and shorter . sending this one back ! i did find success same size in a faux wrap style retailer suit ."
__label__0 "am typically a size 0 and could barely get the extra small on which is a first . was very cute in theory but i 'd suggest sizing up ( maybe 2x ) ."
__label__-1 "this top was very cute but super short- and i am a short waisted petitie person-the waistline hits above your belly button- looks very silly ."
__label__-1 "i love the look of this dress but it runs very large . i am 5 ' 2 110lbs . i ordered the extra small on sale & got a killer deal on it . i intended to use it as a beach cover up since it 's sheer but when i tried it on i felt like i was wearing a mumu . even for the price & for the beach i am going to return it . i 'm sad because it is a beautiful cover-up and for what it is i think the quality is good ."
__label__-1 "i loved this color and ordered it online because i thought it would work for both casual and work days dressed up a little . ummmmm no . it 's weird and boxy and does not look at all like it does on the model . i think maybe if you have no bust whatsoever and size way down it would look okay . i 'm only a 34b weigh 110 pounds 5 ' 3 and it made me look huge and awkward . this is going back !"
__label__0 "this is a pretty dress . i bought a size 0 and the body of the dress fit however the sleeves were too long . had to return as the loose and longer sleeves made the dress look too big on me ."

__label__-1 "i loved the design of this blouse and ordered it the first day it was available . unfortunately i was disappointed on arrival . besides being more muted color-wise the sizing is way off . i ordered the xxsp and it was huge on me . on the model it looks like it skims the body when in reality it falls like a tent . i tried tucking it into a skirt but there was just too much fabric . though the neck worked for me i can see how it might be too small for some people as it is very narrow . also it"

__label__-1 "after readying the reviews of this dress i thought for sure i was purchasing a winner . boy was i wrong ! first this dress feels like a potato sack and looked like one on . i felt that it was very boxy and more of a o ' one size fits all ' sizing . it did not embrace my curves at all . the material was not as chic as i would have thought . overall the entire dress was not flattering . honestly i do not understand what the rave reviews were talking about it ."
__label__0 "this may be lovely on some people but it did n't work on me at all . i thought it would have some swing to it but the bottom hem was tight . if i had gone up a size the top would have been huge . the bib was n't flattering on me and it 's also quite sheer . too bad because the print is great . maybe if you 're athletic with slim hips you can manage it . i think if you are busty this could look like maternity wear on you . back it went sadly ."

__label__1 "i purchased the teal/blue and the color is striking . though i put true to size the decorative top is slightly tight around the bust . and the bottom too is fitted and not flowy . for a looser fit you may want to size up . for a more fitted look it is true to size ."

__label__-1 "these are light and airy and pretty . they also tore the third time i wore them and not on a seam - a little above the knee while i was lying in my bed . they also do not slim the figure and the fabric is slightly see-through as it is so thin therefore if you are looking for serious lounge pants - great - i would not leave the house in them ... or turn over in bed in them . when i sit the slits fall down around my thighs . my son complimented my dress the other day because the slits give way"
__label__0 "this top looks good on model and has great reviews online . however it did not work on my bodytype . when i tried it the slit in the front sat too low . i do n't like showing cleavage because i dress conservatively . other than that i would have loved wearing it . arm cut is not too big such it shows sides of bra bands . overall fit is loose and drapery ."

__label__-1 "i 'm very disappointed in the quality . it seems more like a pajama than a tunic . definitely not worth 100.00 dollars . i plan to return it ."
__label__0 "the design of this dress is darling and so unique and it 's very well made . but i agree it 's very boxy and overwhelming for a petite frame . i 'm 5 ' 3 and ordered the 2 and it was like wearing a hospital gown . if a petite were available i 'd have tried that but this one 's going back . shame too because it 's adorable . the gap in the neckline could easily be stitched or sewn shut but that 's an inconvenience when this dress is already priced so high ."
__label__0 "great cut and fit . tts . size 6 fit my 5 ' 5 135 pound frame ( 34b/c bust ) wonderfully . my sister and best friend loved it on . but i 'm returning . the color is more of a very bright orange than red . i would want to wear this in the middle of summer but the all-polyester fabric is hot . i have too many dresses in my closet . cute as it is i 'd just never pick this one . love to see this design in lighter fabric and different color options . 1-2 longer would also be a slightly better length ."

__label__1 "i got this top in the black and i love it . the bottom is a silky material that 's really beautiful and the cutout details are really pretty . so many of retailer 's sweaters are enormous but this one fits tts . my one complaint is that the bottom white part wrinkles really easily ."
__label__1 "so soft . a casual tunic yet polished and interesting enough for work . darker blue than the photo and the colors are much brighter and prettier in person ."
__label__0 "o.k . i soo wanted to love this dress . if you are slim and small chested it is true to size and lovely . i am slim and tall 5 ' 9 but am large chested . a 36d i usually wear an 8/10 so bought a 10. it was too tight around my chest and back . so i went up a size to a 12. it was better but not exactly comfortable . i could get away with it but for the price had to send it back . the idea of going up another size yet again was a thought but i worried it would n't solve my issue ."
__label__-1 "agree with other reviewer that this is massive even for a cape . unflattering overall . i normally wear a size 2 of 4 and bought this in an xs and two of me can easily fit into this with room to spare . unlined and it itches !"
__label__1 "i love this slip .. i am contemplating whether i can pass it off as a dress over the summer . the skirt is a subtle shinier grey than the top . it is flattering with or without a bra and i am not usually the type to go without . i am 5 ' 3 32c and the xs fits perfectly ! also i think it looks better in person ."
__label__-1 "i ordered these jeans twice because i love them . the first pair were mis-marked by about 4 sizes so i re-ordered . second pair still did n't fit they run really small i would probably need one maybe two sizes larger than normal to achieve the fit and feel of the other skinny jeans in my closet : ("
__label__-1 "i saw tons of people raving about this piece so i had to check it out for myself . i love the vibrant colors and the design and while the fabric is delicate it feels amazing and light . i sadly had to leave it as the store as i am a girl with a larger chest and big hips . i looked huge and it was not flattering to my shape . if this dress came in a maxi with a high waist like i would be all over it . it is beautiful ."
__label__0 "i wish it were easier to get in this dress . i 'm 5 ' 4 with a 36d and i could n't get it on . it 's so pretty though ."
__label__0 "this is a great feminine top i just wish it were a little bit longer for my taste it hit about two inches below my belly button . it was a little snug around the belly area so that 's why i feel it runs small for the brand usually the brand runs true to size but not for this top"
__label__1 "so this shirt is very cute i like the drape ( if you can get it arranged properly ) but it is not black more of a charcoal bordering on heathered navy . i wear all black so it quite obviously stands out as a different color in my closet . i am keeping it thinking i will wear it with leather since it is flattering and the keyhole is something different . i am a true medium and bought the medium and it fits fine . a little shorter in the back but not a deal breaker ."
__label__1 "i 'm 5 ' 4 112 pounds . xs petite was a good fit with room for a heavier top . fabric is somewhat picky so long sleeve is necessary . overall coat is beautiful and worth the money . nice unique fall piece ."
__label__0 "i think these jeans are good for people with long lean legs . i 'm 5 ' 7 155 lbs and the wide cuff made my legs look short and stubby . the weight of the jeans is a little on the heavier side - i usually like soft denim . i usually wear a 31 and thought they were true to size ."

__label__-1 "this is cut very strangely i 'm short waisted and this barely covered my belly button . the material is rough and scratchy . did not like at all and will be returning ."
__label__-1 "i love the fit of these pants -- they 're the perfect slim black pants . however i wore these pants exactly three times before the seams split the middle of the pant in not just one but multiple places . disappointed by the workmanship/quality of the product especially since the pants fit amazingly and do n't sag like other slim fitting black pants tend to do . i hope retailer will take this into consideration and improve the quality of future iterations of this product ."
__label__1 "overall i really like this dress . the color is vibrant & unique . the top of the dress especially the shoulder straps seem loose so i 'm getting it tailored ."
__label__-1 "love the softness and the length . the color was perfect . but you have be be a very skinny almost boney person for you to not show imperfections to your body . the fabric is not thick enough and does not have the give to over shadow normal imperfections . will be returning the sweater ."
__label__1 "these pants are really cute but definitely run small - i ordered a large so they would be a little bigger for lounging and they are not very stretchy . the large fits more like a small in regular sweatpants . there is more blue visible in the top and bottom part of the pants as well which i like ."
__label__0 "got this for my daughter for christmas . she loves the boho peasant look . i thought the fabric would be white or at least cream color but it was closer to pale yellow . although the fabric quality and texture is lovely ( more substantive than i expected ) she just could n't like the top with the color being so off . disappointing as picture makes it much prettier ."
__label__1 "i love wearing this . it is a little slice of summer which i am desperately hanging on to . the color pops it 's so very comfortable & the back is a work of art ! can be dressed up with a pencil summer skirt or down with capri style pants ."
__label__1 "i got this in the color listed as pink . it 's not a usual pink . the fit is good -- not too tight and not too loose . the length is good for a tee ."
__label__-1 "the title says it all . while the quality was good when i put this dress on a felt like i was wearing a shapeless sack fashioned out of wallpaper . the length was longer than on the model ( makes sense since i am only 5 ' 5 ) which was ok but the overall fit was just too big . i am a size 2 and tried the xs which was huge . just not flattering or breezy or sexy in any way . going back !"
__label__-1 "the fabric is a little stiff the back looks unusually long compared to the front and it fits tight across the chest . and i 'm not busty so that 's not a factor ."
__label__1 "the size s arm holes are a little too over-sized and i find i keep adjusting the shoulders so the sides of my bra wo n't show ( and sizing down to an xs made the body too tight ) . it 's a bit pricey for a basic thin tank but it 's a good every day wear all the time staple ."
__label__-1 "i wanted so badly to love this dress but i could n't get past the thin material that you can actually see through . not for this price anyhow . the dress is shorter than i had anticipated and more fitted around the waistline flaring out at the bottom which i feel is n't accurately portrayed in the photo . on the positive though the color is beautiful and the neck line stunning but alas will be returning ."
__label__-1 "completely oversized top size medium was swimming on me ..... boxy baggy shapeless -- what more can i say ? even in an xs this would not have fit in any way like the photo returned ."
__label__-1 "i really wanted to love this dress . i bought it for a photoshoot that will be outdoors and thought that the green color would be perfect . it is well made but the fabric is lighter than expected . the biggest issues was the size . i am 5 ' 7 and typically a size ten . i ordered the ten and it fit like a 14-16. it was huge . if you order this i would say size down two sizes ."
__label__-1 "you have to be a contortionist to get this bra on . it slips over your head and i needed my 8yo daughter to help me pull it down past my elbows . ridiculously impractical . why oh why did n't heather give it a hook and loop closure instead ?"
__label__0 "this jacket is beautiful . the color is so nice and the cut of the jacket is perfect . however one i put it on i could n't wait to get it off . it 's so itchy ! ! i tried putting on a long sleeve shirt under it but was still uncomfortable . especially around my neck . i would n't recommend this jacket based on the material alone . also the jacket runs large . i 'm 5 ' 1 130 lbs 34d and i ordered the small . i would definitely size down ."
__label__-1 "i have several maeve dresses that fit really well . this was not the case with this dress . fabric and color are great ! fit was off especially in top . worst part was zipper that would n't move smoothly . took me a good 15 minutes to get it unzipped . such a bummer !"
__label__0 "when i first opened this dress and tried it on i thought it was adorable . it is very flattering on my hourglass figure and hides my recent baby weight . the problem is the hem . it was already rolling up when i took it out of the package and i should have noticed and returned it but i figured the problem would be easily solved by a good ironing . well it was n't and it gets worse every time i wash the dress . it 's like the hem is n't constructed properly ."
__label__-1 "wanted to love this dress - pretty fabric and colors . i think it would be more flattering on a taller woman ( i 'm 5 ' 3 ordered a s ) this just looked like a nightgown on me . sorry to say it 's going back ."

__label__0 "i have mixed feelings on these . i ordered the honey which is a mustard color as shown in the picture . they are true to size cute and comfortable . i washed them the first time with a load of darks and the color ran onto other clothes . plus the pants looked a little streaked in some areas . i 'm not sure if this was a bad lot but back to the store they went ."
__label__0 "love the dress and went a size up as recommended by other reviewers . but it was still too small . it 's just not roomy enough in the chest -- total boob squash . had to return it ."
__label__-1 "the top on the model in the photo is a true ivory but the top in reality is more beige . well i 'm blonde with fair skin so i 'm not sure this is going to work . it also looks more dressy in the photo than it does in reality -- i think the ivory color on the model and the pleats only down the front make it look more dressy -- but in reality with it really being beige having pleats everywhere and being a crinkly fabric it looks more casual . i had wanted it to be more dressy to pair with skirts"
__label__-1 "and hits below my waist just far enough to make my thighs look enormous . i think how it fits depends alot on body type . the material is nice color pretty not cheap looking so i will keep it but must wear a topper to slim down thise ugly thighs of mine ....."
__label__-1 "the color is nice and the material is what you might find used by a high school drama club with a low budget - a very cheap polyester . on top of that - it is unhemmed and unfinished in any way - so you can bet that about the second or third wearing there are going to be runs all through the thing . i 've attached a picture of the hem below . on top of that - the ruching is awkward ( as mentioned by another reviewers ) . all in all - kind of terrible ."

__label__-1 "after the second wash the stitching in the armpits completely fell apart . after sewing it back up wearing it and washing it a third time the stitching in the other armpit completely fell apart as well . not sure if this was just a fluke but it was very disappointing . now that both armpits are sewn and all other stitches are intact i must say that this is a great dress . i would have returned the dress to retailer but i 've already washed and worn it so again ... very disappointing . i would say"
__label__1 "i just purchased this top in the store . it is definitely not tunic length as shown here but rather hip length . also it runs a little small in the bust and had to go up a size . but it is adorable ."
__label__0 "i love this dress but it is too short to keep . i am 5 ' 8 and weigh 124lbs . most of my cloths from retailer are either a size 4 or a small but this dress is substantially shorter than other dresses purchased from retailer . it looks adorable on but it is just too short ( about 3 inches above my knees ) to be considered professional enough to wear to work ."
__label__0 "cute design for a casual top . however it was a little snug on the bust for a medium . i returned it"
__label__1 "the material is a medium weight jersey knit that is slightly thicker so it provides enough coverage and support to be flattering without being bulky . i think this dress is true-to-size or maybe runs a little bit big but only by a little bit . i bought a medium and am a size 8 in tops and 10 in pants . the dress hugs nicely on the upper body ( arms chest ribs ) and flares just a little bit on the hips/tummy/butt area . it is forgiving of little bumps or lumps . the scoop neckline is a bit lower tha"
__label__0 "i love the look and feel of this easy dress . i loved that it comes with a baby blue slip however i was in between sizes . the medium - a bit too small and the large- just too big . this dress is probably best in a tall thin body type especially in a madras plaid ."
__label__1 "versatile and comfy . can be worn with shirts underneath for multi-seasonal wear ."
__label__0 "... the print is so sharking and i love the way it looks on the model -- but i 'm a more curvy figure and the boxy-ish cut plus rather stuff fabric in front is incredibly unflattering . ordinarily i love everything made by maeve but this one sadly must be returned ... on a thinner/straighter-shaped person i expect it would be great ."
__label__0 "i love this sweater so much and wanted it to be my new favorite but unfortunately it was a bit short for my longer torso . when i raised my arms up it bunched up all wrong because it 's a very thick sweater ."

__label__-1 "first of all this is not pullover styling . there is a side zipper . i would n't have purchased it if i knew there was a side zipper because i have a large bust and side zippers are next to impossible for me . second of all the tulle feels and looks cheap and the slip has an awkward tight shape underneath . not at all what is looks like or is described as . sadly will be returning but i 'm sure i will find something to exchange it for !"
__label__-1 "i ordered the coral/peach version in size 16. it ran small especially compared to other size 14 or 16 maeve blouses i 've purchased . very tight throughout the blouse . the product photos looked so nice compared to what arrived . the material was extremely cheap in quality . it wrinkled terribly . the bow pulled the material down which obscured the look of the eyelet . the idea of this was perfect for my style . unfortunately the poor choice in material & poor fit made this a return for me ."
__label__0 "like a previous reviewer mentioned the jeans do not necessarily look like the one in the photo . i first ordered them in my regular size and also had to notice that they are cut like men 's jeans with legs so skinny that i could only force them over my calves . the embroiding is beautiful but it also stops the material from stretching so the the super skinny legs are a real problem . also they are not as intensely stone washed as shown in the picture . i decided to order them again one size bigger"
__label__1 "the sweater is thinner than i expected but very cute so i 'm keeping it . it seems well made so i 'm not expecting easy snags it washed well ."
__label__0 "this shirt is beautiful and so soft . it would have made a wonderful long-sleeved tee except for the fact that it was so low cut . the only way this is wearable is with a tank underneath which for me defeats the purpose of this type of shirt . i am rather busty ( 34 dd ) so maybe if you are smaller on top you might could pull it off ."
__label__0 "i loved these pants.they are so comfortable . however after just wearing them twice the threads of the leaves are fraying and leaving lint on whatever i sit on . the leaves at the seat of the pants are now slowly disappearing . this after wearing twice to work ! i imagine after a few more wears that the leaves at the seat of the pants will be close to gone or at least much less white with threads then the rest of the places . this is super unfortunate and will be returning . too bad they were l"

__label__1 "the pictures of this sweater do not do it justice . i would have passed it over online but it immediately caught my eye in the store . the yarn is soft and cozy and the flair at the bottom adds a feminine touch . zipper is cute . v-neck is just right - it is not too low . i know i will be wearing this sweater a lot - very happy with this purchase ! i did n't see the pink or navy in the store ."
__label__0 "i was excited about this - - such a lovely look online . but on me ... it was just meh . i 'm a little heavy right now so that could be playing into it ... but i will say i loved the top part of the dress . very flattering and subtly sexy . but the bottom .. it just hangs like a rag . it needs either more material for a swishier effect ... or it needs to be a different material . or maybe knit just does n't work on me in the form of a dress ! the knit is nice but i kind of also feel like it is chintzy ... i ca n't"

__label__-1 "very disappointed . ordered two sizes the fraying of the embroidery was so bad on one of the dresses i would n't have worn it and the zipper was sticking . the second dress had fraying and loose threads as well and the seams at the shoulders were not properly sewn which made the lace at the neckline completely crooked . some of these issues would maybe be acceptable if the dress was under $ 100 but at $ 228 they are not . returning both sizes ."
__label__1 "i saw this in the store on a beautiful autumn saturday afternoon and was inspired for what i wanted to add to my wardrobe for the season . this blouse is just fun without being loud or overpowering . the coloration works beautifully with my wardrobe and i can wear this dressed up or dressed down ; with skirts leggings trousers jeans ... with a vest jacket or sweater or on its own . it is substantial enough not to wrinkle and look sloppy it is easy to launder and will travel well with my capsule"

__label__0 "this sweater is thicker and darker than it appears online . i thought it would be more of a blush color but it 's more dark gray and brown . it was n't that flattering on me as a cardigan . looked a little cuter all buttoned up but ultimately i am not keeping because of the color ."
__label__-1 "i thought the dress was ok but was surprised by the cut away triangles of material right under bra band on the sides of dress . i will send back also a bit too high waisted for me . other than that the dress is as it appears ."
__label__-1 "perhaps i have gotten too used to flowy shirts or the cut of this was not right for me but it felt too fitted around the rear end and the shoulders did n't lay right on me . sizing up would have only made it too big in the shoulders so i returned . i am 5 ' 5 135lbs 34c curvy/muscular frame and ordered a size small ."
__label__0 "this dress was pretty but had a weird fit . the waist droops down in the middle instead of going straight across which i found unflattering . i ended up returning it ."
__label__0 "really liked this dress but it ran too big for me ."
__label__1 "i 'm wearing this top today at work and i feel very cute walking through the hallways . it 's a little long in the back because i 'm short but overall i enjoy wearing it . it 's comfortable casual girly and well made . i 'm happy with it ."
__label__1 "very cute top . the sleeves were more quarter length on me . looks great with jeans"
__label__1 "i saw this t on sale and ordered it . i had second thoughts thinking it would be just like a lot of ts i already have . well i got it today and am thrilled . the fabric is so soft a sumptuous softness that makes me feel good . the fit is the fit we all want in a great t nice fit not too baggy not too tight and it is so flattering . it does n't show off my tummy as so many other ts do . i can wear this with jeans or a skirt . so glad i got it !"
__label__1 "beautiful shirt . the color is more navy than pictured . the middle of the moon is stitched embroiderer - very original and a fun texture . my only qualms with this shirt is the trapezoid cut - it flairs out slightly but enough to notice from shoulders to the bottom hem ."
__label__0 "the color and fabric of this item are so appealing and i think this is a great piece for the right person . the fabric is beautiful but also much thicker than i 'd imagined from the photos . it has a quilted quality so does n't drape very well and is just too much fabric for me around the arms . i typically wear a size 12 and ordered the large . i think a medium might have been better . have n't decided yet whether to exchange for m or just plain return . has an artsy cool professor vibe that i like ."
__label__0 "i purchased this on sale xxs petite and i 'm glad i did . it 's an adorable sweater but i knew the moment i put it on - itch city ! bummer . i wore it with a tank underneath and that helped . it 's a very warm sweater and the style is really cute . looks really soft and cozy but i would say itchy and cozy !"
__label__-1 "this dress looked adorable online but unfortunately it 's not flattering at all and it 's completely see-through . completely . the material is so thin that i ca n't imagine it would hold up very well over time . this one is definitely going back ."
__label__-1 "this is so close to perfect but there 's a seam down the middle of the back and they did n't bother to match the polka dots . you can see the mismatch in the second photo . i was about to buy the jacket and totally in love when i turned and saw the error . i hoped it was one bad match but nope on every one . could n't unsee did n't buy . very disappointed ."
__label__0 "it seems like most people love this tee so you might as well . i returned it because i did n't like how the front hung . if the front was as long as the back i would have kept it . or if the front was short enough to wear with thick pants untucked i might have kept it ( seems like this top would only look good with leggings or skirts ) . i do like the material though . it 's very thin and looks great in the shoulder and neck area . and i liked how the back of the shirt looked when i tried wearing it"
__label__1 "i 'm a little on the fence about this dress . it does n't do much for my fairly straight/petite body type ; i.e . it 's not fitted at the waist which i think would help even though i do n't have much of a waist to begin with . but the low v-neck is flattering and the flared skirt is too . it 's just that it probably looks better on an hourglass shape ... i was fine with the fabric type i 'd describe it as a mid-weight ribbed knit blend . i 'd say it 's true to size i got my usual xspetite and i 'm 34aa 26"
__label__0 "this top would be great if it were longer and the neck was n't so open . even for a boatneck the neck was too wide . for those that do n't mind showing their stomachs this top will be okay . the material is nice and stretchy and i like the stripes but just way too short for me ."
__label__-1 "this jacket is just too small for me anyway and i am no way big . i am tall and athletic and this thing looked like it had shrunk in the wash. there are so many better fitting other types out there this went back"
__label__0 "the fabric felt beautiful and it felt great on but once i looked in the mirror it just looked too housedress like . maybe because it runs large . the price seemed high as well . i wanted to love it but i had to return ."
__label__1 "this dress is extremely comfortable and flattering . it has a forgiving a line shape to it for women like me who are pear shaped . the top of the dress is made of a heavy type of cotton material and the bottom tiers are made of a silky material that hangs beautifully ! even the tie closure in the back of the dress adds a lovely touch to the dress . i would recommend wearing it with leggings ( as shown with the model ) or black tights . the fit is true to size . i am 5 ' 6 and the length is a liittle low"
__label__0 "i was so excited to find this dress in the store ! i immediately headed for the dressing room to try this beauty on .... what a disappointment . the fabric is stunning but the fit is extremely voluminous . i am normally a small to medium so i grabbed a small ...... the only way to describe this dress is tentlike ! it was huge from the waist down . i do n't think i could size to an xs because i am a 34d and the top half of the dress fit perfect ! i was sad to leave the store without this dress ."
__label__-1 "ordered this vest on line and returned it due too poor quality ."
__label__-1 "i saw this dress in the catalog and had to have it . when i went to the store it was sold out so i had them order and ship it to me in two sizes - my regular and one size larger . when i got them i tried on my regular size first and it was just perfect ! beautiful pattern and material . light and airy . sexy with the low-cut keyhole . i am sooo happy with my purchase ."

__label__1 "i absolutely love the print . it 's what caught my eye first when scrolling down the page . the fabric is very soft single layer . the model definitely makes this shirt look slimmer or tighter to the body than the shirt actually is . the slimmer fit was the next thing i was looking forward to but like other reviews it is very flowy and the fabric falls away from the bottom below the bust ( which i 'm not mad about when wearing this in the summer -- the occasional breeze will feel nicer with a loose to"

__label__0 "these are great for summer except you need to size down ! unless the pair i received was an anomaly these run very large !"
__label__-1 "i wanted this sweater to work but sadly it failed . first the pink was way to sheer for my liking . the sheerness caused a weird color overlap on the stomach area . then the band at the bottom was too tight causing a weird ballooning affect . a shirt underneath could work but it takes away from the beauty of the knit . the soft pink is gorgeous but not good for medium to light skinned folks ."
__label__-1 "i had high hopes for this dress but my husband said i looked pregnant and that i was wearing a tablecloth- and he was right ! i 'm usually a size 10 so perhaps this would look good on a talk lanky person with a very long torso ... but probably not . way too much fabric around the midsection . it 's a shame because the fabric was really pretty but too stiff a hand to drape well ."
__label__0 "billowy top - perfect for casual comfort . the topic is definitely not raspberry -- it is a sunset orange . disappointed as i was going for a match . i should have gone off of the picture and not the color name ."

__label__1 "i love this vest ! it is a great color and the inside is very soft ! i will definitely be able to dress it up or down . if you are in between sizes i would definitely size up if you plan on wearing this with a little heavier turtleneck/blouse underneath . it 's amazing ! i feel so confident in it !"
__label__1 "great fun pattern . sexy styling . the other reviewers commented on how the trim is white and the body is ivory- i actually liked that . i am 5 ' 4 and 120 lbs . i usually wear a 4 and ordered a medium in this suit . bottom was super small and is sold out in large so i had to return it"

__label__1 "this top is full of amazing details . the photos really do n't do it justice . it is very flowy and does run large but is so pretty and soft and in beautiful shades of blue . i bought a small and it is fairly long in back on my 5 ' 5 frame but because of the detailing ... it just works ."
__label__0 "i thought i was getting this nice light weight white sweater but not the case . it is a pretty heavy nice thick cotton and beautiful made . it does run large . i got the small and love the oversize feel even on my 5 ' 9 frame . but - it is not white it is beige and it is not light weight . i have enough beige sweaters in this look so this one is going back even though it was a great buy on sale ."

__label__-1 "i thought the photo of these pants was so cute . when i got them in the mail i opened the package and just began to laugh over how long they were . i held the waist up to my chest just below my shoulders and the pants still hit the ground . i am not a short woman ! i ordered a 14 i am 5 ' 6. i also found the waistband a little small in relation to the size ."
__label__-1 "the overall styling was great and the dress is super-cute if a little thick ( it 's made of denim after all ) . i ordered a size down from my normal and even then i was swimming in it . the worst part and the aspect that will make me return it is that the arm holes hang down so low that i 'd have to wear a tank top under the dress . i 'm returning it though it is really cute and i love this brand . the arm holes killed it for me ."
__label__0 "based on other reviews that this top ran large i ordered this online in two sizes . both seemed to fit alright in my chest ( although the chest fit tighter in the smaller size ) and both were much too big on the bottom . the front bottom of this shirt has a series of pleats so the bottom of this top really really really flared out away from my hips . the length seemed fine on me ( 5'10 ) . the material is very thin and i could see my nude bra through the white pattern ."
__label__-1 "was very surprised when i opened the package this dress is very thin fabric and you need to wear a half slip as it is see through . the top of the dress is short to the draw string and does not drape bloused style at all . i have a short waist length so it should have worked . the color is a little darker than pictured but over all looks cheap so full price with tax makes it way over priced . going back asap ."
__label__-1 "i tried this on in my regular size and was able to get it on fine but the cup portion of the suit was just crazy ! with the straps tied tightly around my neck it was like the cups just flipped out and open . i am a regular b cup and i don ; t think it was sizing ( though i did not have the opportunity to try multiple sizes ) . the cup did not right and for this reason would make this absolutely impossible to wear . unfortunate because the design is so pretty ."
__label__0 "i followed the reviews and bought a larger size in the blue stripe . i am usually a size 8 but ordered a 12 ( ok maybe overkill ) . i usually have problems with sleeves being too tight but this was way too big and tent like . i will be hopefully exchanging it in store for a smaller size . stay tuned for an update !"

__label__-1 "this dress is adorable in the photo ; however in reality it fits like a tent . the top would be okay although i would need a smaller size if i were to keep it . it flares out in the skirt to become an a-line and it 's just not very flattering . if i had read the reviews before ordering i would have sized down but i ordered before any reviews had been posted . sadly i must return ."
__label__-1 "this is an adorable basic & i should have been wearing it once a week this summer but instead the fabric developed noticeable holes after the very first wear . this brand makes some of the softest cutest tees but unfortunately more often than not are unwearable after the first or second wash. i wash on gentle & hang dry . not worth the cost ."

__label__1 "i was really pleased with this skirt . the lightness of the fabric is nice and the colors matched the photos . i was initially concerned that it might be stiff and uncomfortable but it feels like it has a bit of stretch and offers some good movement . sometimes retailer skirts seem to run small to me but this fit perfectly in my regularl size ."

__label__-1 "i was really excited about this top since i have others from retailer that are similar in styling . unfortunately it just did n't work out . i am petite with a short torso and ordered my usual size and it was way too short in the front . the top was also boxy and did n't sit right . it just was n't flattering . cute top on the hanger but just not on me ."
__label__1 "the material and design of this beach dress is so pretty . i was hoping that this could be worn as both a dress and a swim suit cover-up but it is only the latter . you ca n't see it from the photos ( the model or mine ) but it is very sheer .... it can really only be worn over a swimsuit . whatever you wear ( or do n't ) will be completely visible . so if you are looking for just a lovely unique beach dress this is it ! unfortunately for the price i need more versatility ! i will consider it on sale !"
__label__-1 "the color says red but it 's more like a rust . i 'm 5 ' 3 so it was long and would need to be tailored and the fabric is so thin i was afraid it would rip if it got caught on anything . finally returned it without it making it out the door : ("

__label__0 "i really wanted this skirt to work but it did n't look very flattering on me . a great midi length and very cool pattern so hopefully will work for others !"
__label__1 "i love the fabric texture mix and length of this top . i gave it a four stars because my usual size is a medium but had to go with a large . a medium felt a bit too snug through the shoulders . very happy with this top and look forward to wearing it a lot ."

__label__0 "yes i bought this dress in anticipation of wearing it right away . it 's not mean for everybody . it would look good on a stick figure . if you have some hips they balloon out ."
__label__0 "i received this top and loved the pattern . however i ordered both and s and m and the bust sizing on this top is very odd . i am a 34c and the bust area was way too big on both but if i had sized down to the xs the rest of the suit would be too small . maybe it 's just made for busty people ? also the supportive material in the bust area goes straight across kind of like a bandeau so that added to the odd look of the bust . it 's still a beautiful pattern so if you 're going to give it a try orde"
__label__-1 "i bought a size small in this dress even though i am usually a large at retailer . it just hung strangely and clung to the unflattering parts of my body but seemed very large . i loved the feel color ( grey ) and style of the dress but i ended up returning it because of the fit . it also requires something under it since it is fairly see-through ."
__label__0 "the fabric and color of this dress is beautiful . two problems with the dress that the picture does not show . 1. it 's long . i 'm 5 ' 5 . this model must be over 6 feet tall as the length hit 5 inches above my ankle and that is not a flattering length . the other issue is that there is toile underneath making the skirt extra puffy . i 'm 42 and the puffiness reminded me of prom . color and fabric great . but had to send back ."
__label__0 "first of all this top runs big . i 'm 5 ' 5 120 and there was still plenty of room to spare in an extra small . this is a cute top but i returned it because it was too stiff and boxy for me . the fabric is thicker than your average tee and there 's not much give so it may not hang well on all body types . i might revisit it if it goes on sale because i like the design with the small details at the sides but this was an easy pass for me at the regular price ."
__label__1 "i bought this top in lavender . this top is light and smooth on your body and true to size . i 'm 5 ' 4 34dd 150 lbs- m fits well . it hides the imperfections in the tummy area and i find myself going for this top a lot . it 's a very easy to put on and take to it off ."
__label__0 "okay so this top has its redeeming qualities i promise ! which is why i gave it 3 stars when i really wanted to give it two . but it 's just not worth 2 because i 'm sure it works for some people and the quality is just impeccable . for people who purchase this it will last forever . it 's sturdy cotton not thin like many retailer tee materials . the lace detail and texture is on point and the neckline is very nice . it 's a great looking top . my issue though was n't with the bust as other reviewers hav"
__label__1 "i was n't expecting much out of this when i was in the store but liked the colors and thought i 'd try it out . grabbed a s and xs ( i 'm usually a s in everything but maeve is weird sometimes ) - the s fit perfectly ( tts ) and the xs felt tight in the shoulder seam as well as in the armpit . it does have a detachable slip/liner that may be too fitted for some of you are prone to that issue . in the model shot i think the horizontal seam at the swing portion looks higher than it was on me ... falling low"

__label__1 "i ordered ivory in xl because this brand tends to run tight if you 're well endowed . it 's a beautiful color and i love the contrasting plaid lining the inside of the collar and cuffs . have n't decided about keeping it because it looks oversized ( but cozy ) and it 's really long . it almost touches the top of my knees in back . sooooo pretty though ."
__label__-1 "this dress is huge . also i was super disappointed in the fabric . i thought it would be silly like a georgette . but it was coarse more like a poplin and thin . i thought it looked cheap ."

__label__0 "this dress was super cute online . i ordered it in small and medium both fit one tighter -- obviously but could have gotten away with either . the dress is cut a little funny under the armpits and fell a little weird in front so i did n't think it was flattering on me . it would be flattering on very slim body smaller on top . i sent it back . i 'm a 34 c athletic build ."

__label__-1 "guess i should 've looked at the pictures more closely . i ordered the white version and in the pictures you ca n't see that the sleeves are split - and it barely shows in the picture for the blue version . it also would 've helped if the detail of the sleeves were noted in the item description . anyway i will be returning this top because i do n't like the way the sleeves look each time i bend my arms . looks a bit pirate-like to me ."

__label__0 "i had reservations about this top based on other reviews but it looked cute on the model so i took my chances . i have an athletic build -- not model-thin but not dumpy either -- and this top made me look very frumpy and matronly . the sleeves were especially unflattering . i purchased it in an ps and might have done better with a pxs ."
__label__-1 "i do not understand all the great reviews but that goes to show everyone likes different things ! the jacket looks great in the pictures but in person it just looks awful ! gray is one of my favorite colors but this color is so drab and the material looks old and worn . it definitely has a grunge look to it and overall it is just a wrinkly mess . another reviewer said it looks like old clothes and i have to agree . it looks very shabby . it also reminds me of those smocks they have at the hair salon"
__label__0 "i so wanted to love this dress despite the reviews . when i opened the package i fell in love with the fabric . the print is absolutely beautiful and the fabric feels luxurious . the dress fit perfectly but there was just too much fabric ( even though i absolutely loved the fabric ) . the flowing overlay was just too much . i am returning it ."
__label__-1 "love the design of the fabric . i actually bought these in both colors . i gave only 1 star due stitching on the fabric it 's very scratchy ."

__label__-1 "so wanted great pair of sweater leggings ... great for running errands and keeping the outfit simple . these are not that . these fit very poorly ... i ordered the small which is more like a large one in the waistline ... there is nothing to hold these up and i could fit two of me in them . unfortunately i thought all would be fine and i discarded the receipt and have worn them a few times~"

__label__0 "they are beautiful in person until you put the on . the fit was a bit weird ; tighter in the waist roomy in the crotch . the fabrics work 100 % against one another . the vegan leather especially the detail pieces at the outer side seams is too stiff . the back is thin and has far too much elasticity . at $ 150 i passed . these will only enter my closet on sale ."
__label__1 "this jumpsuit has the best fit i could ever imagine for a jumpsuit . jumpsuits are always tricky for me but this one fits like a dream . i would say it runs true to size with the exception of being a little bit big in the chest . you could go braless with this jumpsuit as there are nice little cups for the girls but i put on a strapless bra just to fill out the top part . that 's not typically a problem for me being a 32d . i do n't think i could size down though or it would be too tight in the wais"
__label__1 "this is a beautiful casual top ... it is a loose fit that is generously sized so instead of my usual large i purchased the medium for a better fit ... the length is perfect not too long or short ! the colors coordinate great with denim !"
__label__0 "the pattern is very cute ! from the front i liked it but when i turn to the side you can see just how voluminous it is . it ended up looking a bit tenty . if it had just a bit more shape it would be perfect . in the end not the most flattering ."

__label__0 "nice dress you can wash it i got black in med . i am 8-10 in tops and it is perfect brand new is beautiful not sure how it will look after wash. great design . i wish it would be lighter material . material is very thick and heavy for a short sleeve dress . probably will stretch when you sit in car driving . i will be returning it for that reason too heavy for summer ."
__label__0 "i saw this dress in the store months ago and never forgot it so when i saw it on sale i nabbed it online . so sad to see how this dress fits : just right up top just right along the hem and then it 's a hot potato-sack-frump mess in the middle . it 's a shame because the fabric is beautiful ."
__label__0 "i ca n't figure out if this skirt is supposed to be high-waisted ( if so it 's too big but the length works ) or if it 's supposed to sit on my hips ( fits well but too long ) . but the material is really comfortable and the design is different in a good way ."
__label__0 "i tried on 4 different dresses and every one of them had a slightly different awkward hem line . they were asymmetrical but only a tad bit so it just looked crooked . finally found one that was n't so bad but decided not to purchase because the perfect fit for my arms was too big in the boobs . i am a curvy athletic build with broad shoulders and small waist for your reference ."
__label__-1 "cute in theory i love the bright colors the tied black collar sash and the 70 's vibe however the fabric is cheap and the worst part in my view is that the seams that run along the front center of the shirt do not align the pattern . maybe this was intentional but with the shirt i received it looked horrible . i sent it back . i notice in the picture that the black ties are strategically placed over the center front seam so it is a bit deceiving . i would n't buy this top at any price based on"

__label__-1 "i saw this sweater on-line and loved it until i tried it on . i 'm 5-7 flat chested 135 pounds and i ordered a size small . the sweater fit everywhere except for my arms . this sweater will work great if you are short . consider making your sweaters a little longer because i do not consider myself tall ."

__label__-1 "i purchased this top in the black and tan color loved the fit style and fabric . however it is a loose weave and after just one wearing a hole opened up on the front which could not be repaired . it was covered by the cowl neck collar but as the day wore on the hole got bagger and it can no longer be hidden . i was very disappointed in the quality of this top- i purchased it at full price and was only able to wear it once . i just did n't have the time to return it to the store ."
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this top but it unfortunately did not work for me . the material has a nice weight and feel to it and while i love the pattern the shape leaves something to be desired . the cap sleeves were a little tight on my arms and the cut of the sleeves made my arms look big . the body of this shirt reminded me of a loose maternity top . for reference i am 5'10 140 lbs and typically a size 6. i wear a small in retailer clothes and got a small in this top . i think an xs would have been to"
__label__-1 "this romper is cute well-made and true to size but i have n't figured it out how to put this on without having someone tie the back ties . which pretty much means that going to the bathroom is not an option while you have this romper on . not sure what the designers were thinking here . i 'm returning this one ."
__label__1 "the top runs small it is a very sexy and slimming top . i tried in l it was too small so i have ordered it in xl . i hope it fits because it is very fitted and i am worried that the bottom will roll to the top with a fabric like this . but it is a very sexy good looking and slimming top . i love it ! !"

( please make more ! ! ) however this shirt did n't work for me . i think it 's a matter of where your curves live . the shirt was true to size but my boobs meant i was showing more cleavage than the model and the top part felt more like a bib than embroidery . sad coz it is lovely and feels lovely on . probably a great shirt for different body types . would love to see more green clothing ...."
__label__-1 "i tried this dress on in store . i loved it online but in person .... not so much . it looked and felt like a cheap halloween costume . the fabric was bad . really bad .. the mustard color was beautiful .... boo"

__label__0 "purchased the gray patterned top . seemed to fit tts but it did n't fit me . i 'm an athletic build with a 34d bust and it just would n't fit right around the shoulder/neck area . i 'm pretty confident it would fit someone who is less busty than i. the double-sided fabric was soft and felt like it would wash/wear very well . nice length all around ... top and sleeves ."
__label__0 "i got this top planning to wear it with the sleeves up rather than off the shoulder like in one of the photos . my regular size ( medium ) was way too large so i went down to a small . however the collar was still too wide for the sleeves to stay above my bra straps . back it goes . if you 're looking for a strictly off-the-shoulder top you might like it . color is deep blue and the cotton is a nice weight ."
__label__0 "i adore this blouse but the cut is a bit weird . the shoulders fit snugly and the body is blousy/boxy . the colors are super cute and the cutouts are unique but i do n't think this top is for everyone ."
__label__0 "this dress is not what i expected . the bottom half is wool-like material-looks like someone has worn it . the top snags easily so you must be careful when wearing jewelry . when i received the dress i noticed there were two small holes under the arms . i would n't of paid full price but for the amount i sewed up the holes and packed it away for winter ."

__label__-1 "i have been struggling to find a nice flowy summer dress that is n't too short . i am petite but do not like to wear my dresses too far above the knee so i ordered this in the 00 regular . this dress was not what i expected . it is not flowy but rather a heavy and stiff fabric . it is also way too wide . it looks like it ca n't decide whether to be a box or a bag . it is also shorter than advertised . last thing to disappoint was the color - darker and more muted than the photo on the website . i ca n't"

__label__-1 "these fit around the waist but there is so much fabric and it poofs out and looks awful and bulky . no way ."
__label__-1 "the quality and fabric of this dress are lovely but unfortunately i found it to be very unflattering and shapeless . it fit me like a sack i ordered the m and i suppose i should 've sized down but even in the s i 'm afraid this would be far too large . for reference i am 5 ' 7 and 135 lbs . i have a curvy build so this shape dress just was n't right on me . i imagine it will look cute on more of a boyish figure . returned ."

__label__1 "i tried these on on a whim because i liked the shirt that they were displayed with in the store and was surprised how much i liked them ! they are a great lighter weight alternative to the pilcro hyphen chino . great for hot days of summer . the subtle vertical stripes go with everything and help elongate the leg . overall a really flattering cut . the waist is not too low and does not create muffin top ."
__label__-1 "the sleeves on this top always caught my eye every single time i was in a store . they never had my size to try on so when a free shipping offer came up i ordered the ivory top in a size large . well the sleeves are indeed stunning but that is all that is attractive about this top ! the rest was a plain blank white canvas . in fact that 's what it felt like to wear it -- like i was wearing a tent or an artist 's canvas on my chest . yuck ! how can this designer put so much thought and care into t"
__label__1 "as all the reviews say it is completely sheer . it 's a very cute top other than that ."
__label__-1 "i really loved this vest online and decided to try it on in store . it was really cute on and fit nicely so i purchased it ( in my normal size ) and took it on a vacation . first time wearing it and the color transferred all over my white shirt even though it says it is pre-washed . i am very disappointed considering how expensive this was . overall it is very cute but it may ruin your clothes so beware !"
__label__1 "trying hard to stay away from tops that are basic tees and branch out with patterns and different cuts . never thought i 'd find both in one top . love this ! i put it on and knew i had to take it home . it 's fitted but not busy but just enough so and it 's made in the usa ! ca n't go wrong ."
__label__1 "i like this dress . the floral pattern and little red beads . others may think it is baggy however i like this type of the style ."
__label__1 "love this crinkle cotton top for spring . the print is great and i ca n't wait to wear it !"
__label__-1 "disappointed : - ( this top has a boxy shape and looked like a mini moo moo on me . i have a similar shape as the model and it looked nothing like that on me . bummer ! i liked the quality and weight ( not too heavy nor too light ) but shape is unflattering . it 's going back ."
__label__0 "i loved this top when i saw it online and i still love the idea of it . unfortunately the execution of the design fell short . i 'm 5 ' 4 w/ a long lean torso . i ordered my usual small and the arms on the shirt were so long ! b/c of the way the sides of the top cut up and my 34 d chest i do n't think a petite would work for me . such a cute top but it just wo n't work for me ."
__label__1 "it 's too hot here in ca to wear this yet but i ca n't wait for cooler weather . i tried it on with skinny jeans and it 's darling . love how it 's much shorter in front with the side splits and long back to cover the bum . perfect for leggings . nice slim but not tight fit ."
__label__-1 "this picture does not represent these jeans .. the color is way off . they are more yellow toned and look much more worn than in the picture . they also run very small ."
__label__0 "i was wondering whether to purchase this top and decided last weekend during the 20 % off event i would splurge ! ! ! i got the m as i 'm tall ( 5'10 ) and it does look a little strange on the arms atleast on my body . the sleeve is cut too high for me . i wish it was longer or even a long-sleeved item ! the peach-apricot- nude colored fabric is a little uncomfortable and the fabric close to the neck is a different grey from the other sweatshirt pieces . the sweatshirt pieces are n't particularly soft eit"
__label__0 "i really wanted this to work . alas it had a strange fit for me . the straps would not stay up and it had a weird fit under the breast . it worked standing up but the minute i sat down it fell off my shoulders . the fabric was beautiful ! and i loved that it had pockets ."
__label__0 "i was really excited about this romper and when it arrived it looks just like the picture . the torso was abnormally long and i get this is supposed to be a relaxed fit but it sagged way too much for my liking . i 'm 5 ' 9 32c and i wear 28 size pants usually i struggle with too short of a torso in romper/jumpsuits but not this one . i ordered a medium and felt like it was way too big . i probably could have gone down a size but i was n't loving it enough to try . the fabric is nice but the tiny clasp"
__label__1 "absolutely adore this jacket . i 'm typically a true medium at retailer and the medium fit perfect . the small actually fit really well to and had a little room for sweaters under it but i decided to stick with the medium just so i could bundle up if need be . so perfect and beautiful the embroidery is gorgeous i feel so feminine in this coat"
__label__1 "i love this dress it is very photo friendly which is a big plus for me . i am not the tallest person 5 ' 4 but i had to be careful not to get my sleeves in the food i was preparing . perhaps the sleeve length is a bit longer on me but i had to be very cautious while trying to put the finishing touches on our holiday feast . it 's just something to be aware of . i suggest sushi or a nice cheese plate if you want to wear it as the hostess ."
__label__0 "i love holding horses and i am always be size 2 in their clothes ( 32dd 5 ' 3 curvy ) . i ran into my local retailer to grab a shirt they had on hold and had to try this on because it 's so cute . i could n't get the 2 zipped and it seemed to be rather narrow in the torso . such a bummer !"
__label__1 "this really is a pretty top . i do wish it was a little thicker but it 's not as see-through as other tees i 've seen ."
__label__0 "i liked this top i really did . i also liked the subtle shimmer . the fabric did n't seem as soft but i could not get over the big difference in length between the front and the back . you can see it on the model here but when i tried it on it was even more obvious and just did n't look right . asymmetrical tops look better when the length difference is not so large but here it is . the print at the top also made my shoulders look a little broader . i am sending it back ."
__label__1 "i love ag for their soft stretchy denim and flattering fit . bought these today and could n't be happier ! i usually order stevies in the petite ankle size but the regular capri length fit perfectly skimmed my ankle ."
__label__1 "cute casual drawstring short . runs a little large but nice style for an oversized look . nice length for long legs ."
__label__-1 "i do n't know how to explain but this dress at least for me did not look like the model first off the dress is extremely heavy and extremely long and then where the fur starts for me it did n't start at the right spot so it was very awkward looking ... so definitely not for my type of body i am normal height ( 5 ' 5 '' athletic and curvy body ) but maybe for a very tall person looks good ! the material is very interesting it 's so soft !"
__label__1 "this top is really cute . the fabric is soft with a little stretch to it . the lace shoulders with the denim cutouts add so much to this top . i was afraid it might make it too stiff & bulky around the shoulders but it does n't . very cute . the armholes are cut on the bigger side but not so big that it shows your bra strap or anything . ( just comfortable ) the cut is also very nice and the pleats make it more body slimming . runs pretty tts . i ordered my usual medium and it 's not quite as form fitting"
__label__0 "what a huge disappointment ! i was really looking forward to wearing this top but it is very tight and awkward around the bust . if you have any semblance of a chest this is not for you ! i am a 38c and this was a no go . the quality of the top seems to be top notch but the fit was just no . it felt restrictive and it was hard to even move my arms and i have slender arms ."
__label__1 "i have this in darker blue and it is my favorite dress of the season . i did n't realize that there was one in turquoise until it was already sold out . please bring back or be so kind to contact me if an xs comes in as a return etc . i love this so much !"
__label__-1 "ok ladies .... you need to know that this type of fabric is the one that will get holes ( i bought the white one ) . it is super thin and lovely but i was only able to get two wears out of it . i did wash it and it maintained it 's size because i restretched it while wet then hung to dry . i was super disappointed about the wear but appreciated being able to return it without question at my local retailer ."
__label__0 "i ordered this blouse as a gift for my mom . it is too pricey to live up to my expectations . it is quite sheer and the hem of the sleeves are unfinished which you ca n't see in the pictures . this makes a very expensive blouse look cheap . it is made of viscose and dry clean only . the material used is not on par with the price in my opinion . if it had been real silk or another natural fiber ok. but for me this and the unfinished hem along with the price is a deal breaker for me ."
__label__1 "i was not impressed upon first taking it out of the package it was a wrinkled mess lighter weight than i imagined and i felt like it hung like a potato sack . however after i gave it a good ironing and used the inside back tie to sinch in the waist i was in love . it draped beautiful the blue has beautiful embroidered detail and i love the full length sleeves that can be rolled . i feel iike i will use for many seasons ."
__label__1 "color is beautiful fits perfectly lace is lovely and cut is feminine and flattering . hoping to top with a sweater so i can wear it longer in the season ."
__label__-1 "the lace and fit were good . but the length seemed awkward to me given how boxy and flowy-ish the dress is . it felt like a baby doll with sleeves or something . and i hated the outside middle material hated it . it felt cheap and odd when compared to the lace . maybe i was just not in the right demographic for this piece ."
__label__1 "i bought this shift dress for a black & plaid nye event and it fit the bill perfectly for a cold winter 's night . looks great with tights and boots has pockets and dresses up nicely . i like a good shift at this point in the holiday season -- leaves room for that last bit of seasonal eating and drinking . looking forward to wearing this through the winter months ."
__label__0 "im 5 ' 1 and about 110lbs . ordered the small because i do have some curves- it was huge- more like a large and didnt have much structure at all . the wool was very soft and stretchy . and like others have said- kinda orange- not true coral color . it fit me like a throw blanket- its going back for sure . might purchase again if the petite xs is back in stock and on sale- this should def be under $ 100 ."
__label__1 "i just received this in the wine color and it 's gorgeous ! it fits well and is very pretty . it can be dressed up or down . i ca n't wait until the weather warms up and i get to wear this . i have already ordered the other color ! great purchase ."
__label__1 "it 's a pretty dress my only concern is the sleeve length . it 's an awkward length and makes the dress look a little frumpy . i turned the sleeve up once and it looks so much better ! . or if you are a savvy sewer you may want to tighten a little in the arms so the sleeve is a bit more fitted . overall quality and feel is very good . i usually fit into a 6 but for this dress i ordered both 6 and 8 and kept the 8. the chest is a bit snug and the button pops open if you do n't order the correct size ."
__label__1 "this skirt is great for anyone who wants to highlight a defined waistline but may want to skim over a few lumps and bumps . the skirt has a nice wide waistband that hugs tight at the middle and pleats that give a little flare without being too much . the fabric is nice and thick and the skirt is lined . i am looking forward to wearing it to the office with a fitted dark top and heels ."
__label__1 "this is such a pretty top . i love the mix of patterns . the colors are beautiful ! it really looks great on . the peplum is very minimal in this top . the entire top itself is somewhat oversized but in a pretty way . i bought this in a large and probably could have gone with a medium but did n't want the length to be any shorter so i 'm sticking with the large . for reference i 'm 6ft and 175lbs . i usually wear a size 10/12 or medium/large . also i did n't notice a puckering between the two m"

__label__-1 "thought this would be a great dress for warm days but alas it fit like a sack . love floreat and have a few of their well made dresses . shame this did nothing for my curves . ordered an 8 usually wear a 10 and it was a tad narrow in the shoulders . if you can sport a loose swingy shape this is a great dress with nice detailing but sadly the shape did not work for me ."
__label__0 "what a let down . this is not what i would call a coat but a sweater . it is unlined and very lightweight . the fit was cute and would have been so great if it was actually a coat ."

__label__0 "just so i 'm clear the only reason i said it runs large is b/c of the top portion but the bottom or waist . loved this romper when i saw it online it was however too big in the top portion . the straps are adjustable but the back is too low for a bra and it gaps too much in the front unless you are standing straight all day . also b/c i 'm 5 ' 8 the small was just a tad too short definitely no bending ! i 'm 5 ' 8 tall 127lbs with an average size chest # 34c # i ordered a small and the bottom"

__label__-1 "it is a beautiful sweater but it is cropped and boxy ."
__label__1 "this is ruching done right ! i tried this dress on and the two other women who saw me in it went to try it on as well . it is fitted but comfortable and because it is well cut the ruching hides a multitude of sins to leave you looking sleek and curvy in all the right places . it is also a versatile layering piece and would look great with almost anything . so unless this particular color is your nemesis this dress is a winner !"
__label__1 "love this top ! i tried it on in the store and instantly loved . i wore it and ordered it in another color . i bought my usual size but decided i 'd like to have it slightly smaller for the next one so i ordered down . it can go either way it 's quite flawy and roomy . cool for summer and supper flattering ."
__label__-1 "i ordered this top in a 14 my usual size and it fits fine but it is way too short-waisted ! it looks nothing like what the model is wearing . her top comes low on her waist almost to her crotch area . mine was just about 2 inches below my belly button ! it was almost as if they accidentally cut off the lower half of the top at the factory ! very strange ."
__label__0 "i so wanted to love this dress but the bell sleeves were enormous ! if you 're standing completely still with your arms down they look cool but if you move your arms at all it looks like you have wings . the rest of the dress was beautiful though and a flattering swingy shape even on an hourglass/pear shaped figure . i would recommend sizing down as the dress runs large ."
__label__0 "this is such a cute design but it 's so short ! it barely hits at my hips . you 'd have to wear a layer under it to keep your tummy from being exposed . i 'm also not thrilled with the buttons - i am a 34c bra size and the second button was gaping open on the size 4 top . i wish they 'd been sewn shut - the neckline is so big it 's not like the buttons need to function . i got the burgundy with pink flowers and the colors are great . too bad it 's so short and gapes open at the bust . going back ."
__label__-1 "i loved the look of this sweater but the workmanship was surprisingly poor . there were missed stitches and loose threads throughout and even a tag sewn to the outside . retailer was great about the return . i really wanted to keep it and was very disappointed ."
__label__1 "i waited so long for a small petite to come back in stock and finally it did ... received the dress last week and it 's beautiful it was a perfect fit for me not to big not too small ( my size 5 ' 3/122lb ) . if you 're petite or very thin probably size down . i gave it 4 stars because of the quality ... some of the eyelets looked a little weathered . it is lined and there 's no see through . agree with other reviewers though - this dress is not worth $ 228 price tag ."
__label__-1 "i was so excited when i purchased this top ! it was going to be my go to for running around as it looked super cute with leggings and boots ! the softness alone made me feel like i was wearing my pajamas ..... so comfy ! that all changed after one washing ...... it is now pilling and not nearly as soft as before ! makes me sad but it is going back !"
__label__1 "pretty top . quality material it is not thin and see through . size down because this runs large . although it is meant to be flowy if you do n't size down the arm holes will show your bra and the rest of the body will have too much fabric looking too boxy and unflattering ."

__label__-1 "i loved the criss cross part of this tank . however it looked so frumpy on . the cut was just odd and if you are petite it felt like a tent . i was so bummed because that criss cross was awesome but it just looked so weird on . i returned it . the material felt nice too ."
__label__-1 "i ordered this dress in the blood orange and have a few complaints . while it appears to be made with quality it runs really large . also in the picture the fabric appears to have a sheen and be somewhat dressy . the actual fabric is just flat cotton . it 's a very casual dress not as dressy as pictured . it 's also quite shapeless on . i 'm returning it ."
__label__1 "i get so many compliments every time i wear this dress . friends strangers younger older and even the pharmacist at my drugstore wanted to know where i bought the dress . it has a 70 's vibe to it fun and swingy . perfect for fall in florida with sandals or when it gets cooler i think it will look great with leggings and boots . i purchased the orange and dark gray in a medium petite ( i 'm 5 ' 4 ' and 135 ) and it hit just above my knee . my favorite dress right now !"
__label__0 "i so wanted to love this dress . i bought it in a size 4 and in both petite and regular as i 'm kind of in between and have a long torso and short legs . anyway i 'm 5 ' 5 tall and 130 lbs . the regular fit my torso well and length not was too bad . with heals it might have worked without hemming . here is where it all fell apart . while understand that only really expensive designer clothing can afford to seam a pattern perfectly i felt that the dot seam in the front of the dress was in a bad place ."
__label__-1 "i saw this dress in the catalog and immediately ran to the store to purchase . then i realized the dress in the catalog is slightly different but the small differences is what makes the catalog dress so much more unique and worth the money ! look at the top the stripe colors are different . and the stripes flow different on the skirt part as well . and the dress was short on me and i 'm two inches shorter than the model . bummer ."
__label__0 "i had such high hopes for this dress and really wanted it to work for me . i initially ordered the petite small ( my usual size ) but i found this to be outrageously small . so small in fact that i could not zip it up ! i reordered it in petite medium which was just ok. overall the top half was comfortable and fit nicely but the bottom half had a very tight under layer and several somewhat cheap ( net ) over layers . imo a major design flaw was the net over layer sewn directly into the zipper - it c"
__label__0 "these pants come in great colors and fit nicely if you determine your correct size which may not be what you usually wear . i have several pair but i am concerned about investing anymore because of all the complaints on dye stability . retailer is going to have to address this if it is going to continue carrying this product . now that said i had a bad accident on one pair of these pants and the outcome was successful . i wore them to a dinner party and spilled grease on them from one of t"
__label__0 "i 'm 5 ' 6 '' athletic build-thought it was cute but in the end did n't like the color of the inner sweatshirt -- wish it was black or white . send it back ."
__label__0 "i was really excited for this sweater its not terrible but its not great . the sweater was large making me feel like a blob in it . it is warm and the fabric is pretty there was just no shape to it . i would try a different sweater ."
__label__1 "i ordered a bunch of clothing from retailer last week and this is by far my favorite purchase ! the detail is gorgeous it 's very soft and figure flattering ."
__label__0 "this sweater is extremely roomy . the cut is very wide - wider than it is long the sleeves are dolman style and the neck is a little loose . with a lot of manipulation i managed to convince myself that i was n't wearing a tent but i would suggest sizing down and also being tall and thin if you can . i 'm keeping mine despite a funky fit on my hourglass frame because i 'm exploring funky town lately . join me at your own risk !"
__label__1 "these are very cute and i bought both colors . they are accurately pictured . however right out of the bag they had an especially strong chemical-type odor . must be the dye . i have been airing them outside in the sun trying to decide if i will keep them . they seem to be calming down a bit but it 's been two days ! ! they are not jersey but are a non-stretchy type fabric with a slight sheen . dress up or down . i 'm a 00 or 24 and the xs fit well ."
__label__0 "tried the navy in store . boy does it run big ! i 'm normally a size 6 / small ( ish ) . 5 ' 6 34a-28-36 . the xs was still quite boxy on me while the sleeves were well fitted . i understand this is the style and i like the design with the different sleeves . it was a no buy as the main fabric was already pilling in store and looked a bit cheap - sorry !"
__label__-1 "like the previous review said i was excited to receive this top . i had grand visions of all the ways i could wear it ! to my chagrin when i put it on it just fell right down and pooled around my waist . i wish there were smaller sizes to order . sadly this is going back ."
__label__1 "this sweater coat is perfect . i 've been looking for one i loved for years . in my opinion it runs true to size . i ordered my usual xsp . it is fitted in the arms and loose on the body . i love it ."
__label__-1 "i loved them on when i got them but they literally frayed apart on my body as i wore them and i had them on no more than 5 times . it was not a fit issue or a seam issue ; they literally just frayed apart in two areas . while flattering and incredibly comfortable the fabric was not at all durable ... they are not your typical denim they almost kind of a knit feel them ."
__label__0 "i ordered the xxs p but the actual cardigan is a xs p. i was bummed as the xxs p are sold out . well it fits ok anyway . ( 115 lbs 30dd 26.5 in waist ) beautiful sweater but oh so itchy . i think wool should be listed first ( like ingredients ) it is really itchy . why i so torn . i want to keep it because it is nice but it is itchy . i will have to try it with a long sleeve shirt underneath i do n't think i can hang with ah short sleeve or sleeveless . colors and pattern are warm neutral not red ."
__label__-1 "i love love love this print and had to have it when retailer had their 25 % off sale . i think regular price is way too much for this dress as the dress is n't even silk or a better material . but once i got this i was so disappointed i ordered my usual size and it was just a balloon/tent on me . i felt like i was wearing a maternity dress . plus the ruffle at the top which i thought was a sweet feature felt really awkward and like it was grazing my neck and chin in an annoying way . i do n't even want t"
__label__0 "this dress had so much promise from the picture . i loved the midi length color and fascinating waist detail . i ordered online so there was no way to try on before purchasing . the fit was disappointing . it fell in an unflattering manner at every point ; a tad too low at the waist ; a tad too long at the shin . just kind of saggy all around . bummed but this is not to say it would n't fit someone with a different body shape better . the quality of fabric is nice and the color is lovely ."
